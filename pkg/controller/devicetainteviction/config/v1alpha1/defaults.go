// function to allow consumers of this type to set whatever defaults for their
// embedded configs. Forcing consumers to use these defaults would be problematic
// as defaulting in the scheme is done as part of the conversion, and there would
// be no easy way to opt-out. Instead, if you want to use this defaulting method
// run it in your wrapper struct of this type in its `SetDefaults_` method.
