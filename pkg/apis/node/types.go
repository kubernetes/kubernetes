// RuntimeClass defines a class of container runtime supported in the cluster.
// The RuntimeClass is used to determine which container runtime is used to run
// all containers in a pod. RuntimeClasses are (currently) manually defined by a
// user or cluster provisioner, and referenced in the PodSpec. The Kubelet is
// responsible for resolving the RuntimeClassName reference before running the
// pod.  For more details, see
// https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md

	// are specific to the node & CRI configuration.  It is assumed that all
	// handlers are available on every node, and handlers of the same name are
	// equivalent on every node.
	// For example, a handler called "runc" might specify that the runc OCI
	// runtime (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers
	// in a pod.
