	//   but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
	//   skew.
	// A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
	// if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
	// "MaxSkew" on some topology.
	// For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
	// labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
	// +-------+-------+-------+
	// | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
	// +-------+-------+-------+
	// | P P P |   P   |   P   |
	// +-------+-------+-------+
	// If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
	// to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
	// MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
	// won't make it *more* imbalanced.
	// It's a required field.

	// Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods

	// MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
	// When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
	// Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
	// And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
	// this value has no effect on scheduling.
	// As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
	// scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
	// If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
	// Valid values are integers greater than 0.
	// When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
	//
	// For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
	// labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
	// +-------+-------+-------+
	// | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
	// +-------+-------+-------+
	// |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
	// +-------+-------+-------+
	// The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
	// In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
	// because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
	// it will violate MaxSkew.
