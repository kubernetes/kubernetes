    # If fluentd consumes its own logs, the following situation may happen:
    # fluentd fails to send a chunk to the server => writes it to the log =>
    # tries to send this message to the server => fails to send a chunk and so on.
    # Writing to a file, which is not exported to the back-end prevents it.
    # It also allows to increase the fluentd verbosity by default.
