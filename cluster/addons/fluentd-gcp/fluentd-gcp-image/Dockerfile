# This Dockerfile will build an image that is configured
# to use Fluentd to collect all Docker container log files
# and then cause them to be ingested using the Google Cloud
# Logging API. This configuration assumes that the host performning
# the collection is a VM that has been created with a logging.write
# scope and that the Logging API has been enabled for the project
# in the Google Developer Console.
