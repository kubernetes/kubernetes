                  the value on creation is empty or nil), Calico defaults Types according
                  to what Ingress and Egress rules are present in the policy.  The
                  default is: \n - [ PolicyTypeIngress ], if there are no Egress rules
                  (including the case where there are   also no Ingress rules) \n
                  - [ PolicyTypeEgress ], if there are Egress rules but no Ingress
                  rules \n - [ PolicyTypeIngress, PolicyTypeEgress ], if there are
                  both Ingress and Egress rules. \n When the policy is read back again,
                  Types will always be one of these values, never empty or nil."
