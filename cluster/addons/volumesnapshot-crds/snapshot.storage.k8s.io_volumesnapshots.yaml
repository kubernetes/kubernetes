                storage system. In dynamic snapshot creation case, it will be filled

                to a VolumeSnapshotContent object and the underlying storage system
                has the information available. If not specified, it indicates that

                waiting for the snapshot to be created based on the type of error
                reported.

              description: readyToUse indicates if a snapshot is ready to be used
                to restore a volume. In dynamic snapshot creation case, readyToUse
                will be set to true after underlying storage system has successfully
                finished all out-of-bound procedures to make a snapshot ready to be
                used to restore a volume. For a pre-existing snapshot, readyToUse
                will be set to the value returned from CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call
                if the matching CSI driver exists and supports. Otherwise, this field
                will be set to "True". If not specified, it indicates that the readiness
                of a snapshot is unknown.

            restoreSize:
              description: restoreSize represents the complete size of the snapshot
                in bytes. The purpose of this field is to give user guidance on how
                much space is needed to restore a volume from this snapshot. When
                restoring a volume from a snapshot, the size of the volume MUST NOT
                be less than the restoreSize. Otherwise the restoration will fail.
                If this field is not specified, it indicates that underlying storage
                system does not have the information available.
