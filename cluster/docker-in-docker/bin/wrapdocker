  # The two following sections address a bug which manifests itself

  # trying to start containers withina container.
  # The bug seems to appear when the cgroup hierarchies are not
  # mounted on the exact same directories in the host, and in the
  # container.

  # Named, control-less cgroups are mounted with "-o name=foo"
  # (and appear as such under /proc/<pid>/cgroup) but are usually
  # mounted on a directory named "foo" (without the "name=" prefix).
  # Systemd and OpenRC (and possibly others) both create such a
  # cgroup. To avoid the aforementioned bug, we symlink "foo" to
  # "name=foo". This shouldn't have any adverse effect.
