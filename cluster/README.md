# Cluster Configuration

##### Deprecation Notice: This directory has entered maintenance mode and will not be accepting new providers. Deployments in this directory will continue to be maintained and supported at their current level of support.

The scripts and data in this directory automate creation and configuration of a Kubernetes cluster, including networking, DNS, nodes, and control plane components.

See the [getting-started guides](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides) for examples of how to use the scripts.

*cloudprovider*/`config-default.sh` contains a set of tweakable definitions/parameters for the cluster.
