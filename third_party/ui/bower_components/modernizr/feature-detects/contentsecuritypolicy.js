// Test for (experimental) Content Security Policy 1.1 support.
//
// This feature is still quite experimental, but is available now in Chrome 22.
// If the `SecurityPolicy` property is available, you can be sure the browser
// supports CSP. If it's not available, the browser still might support an
// earlier version of the CSP spec.
//
// Editor's Draft: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/content-security-policy/raw-file/tip/csp-specification.dev.html
