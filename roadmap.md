## Prioritized Issues

### 🟠 High Priority

Important issues that should be addressed soon to maintain quality and user experience.


#### Issue #2: [Scheduler] Add an extension after PostFilter that will always execute

**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** OPEN
**Author:** romanbaron
**Created:** 2026-02-02T12:46:59Z
**URL:** https://github.com/omer-dayan/kubernetes/issues/2

**Summary:**
I am a plugin developer, the plugin will have different actions according to the preemption result. For example, mark the podGorup (API in schedule-plugins) as failed and reject all the pods when failed to preempt, or I will mark the pods as schedulable (I will limit the number of times to schedule any pods in PodGroup for the performance). But when any of the plugin return code other than fwk.Unschedulable, scheduler will skip all plugins after that. This makes difficult to implement the PostFilter: If we run coscheduling before preemption, we can not know the preempt result. 

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Detailed investigation of root cause
- [ ] Reproduce issue in test environment
- [ ] Develop and test fix
- [ ] Code review and merge
- [ ] Verify fix and close issue

- Required prerequisite work

## Development Timeline

### Immediate (This Week)
- Address all critical priority issues
- Begin work on high priority bugs

### Short-term (1-2 Weeks)
- Complete high priority issues
- Start medium priority enhancements

### Medium-term (1 Month)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Triage Meeting:** Review all critical and high priority issues with the team
2. **Assignment:** Assign owners to top priority issues
3. **Investigation:** Gather more details on issues lacking information
4. **Planning:** Create detailed implementation plans for complex issues
5. **Development:** Begin implementation work on prioritized items
