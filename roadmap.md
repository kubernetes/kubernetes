## Priority Analysis

### High Priority Issues


#### Issue #2: [Scheduler] Add an extension after PostFilter that will always execute

**Status:** OPEN
**Author:** romanbaron
**Created:** 2026-02-02T12:46:59Z
**URL:** https://github.com/omer-dayan/kubernetes/issues/2

**Description:**
```
### What would you like to be added?

I am a plugin developer, the plugin will have different actions according to the preemption result. For example, mark the podGorup (API in schedule-plugins) as failed and reject all the pods when failed to preempt, or I will mark the pods as schedulable (I will limit the number of times to schedule any pods in PodGroup for the performance).
But when any of the plugin return code other than fwk.Unschedulable, scheduler will skip all plugins after that. This makes difficult to implement the PostFilter:

If we run coscheduling before preemption, we can not know the preempt result.
If we run coscheduling after preemption and preempt return error (for example the pod is deleted when in schedulingCycle), we are not able to reject the podGroup because the scheduling stop the iteration for the PostFilter.


### Why is this needed?

## Dependencies

*Dependencies will be analyzed during detailed issue review. Check for:*
- Dependencies between issues
- External library or infrastructure dependencies
- Prerequisite tasks or configurations

## Timeline

- **Immediate:** Address high-priority issues
- **Short-term:** Review and triage new issues
- **Medium-term:** Implement fixes and improvements
- **Long-term:** Maintain stability and performance

## Next Steps

1. Review all open issues
2. Assign priorities and owners
3. Identify dependencies and blockers
4. Create implementation plan
5. Begin development work
