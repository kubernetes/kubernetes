  description: When a Pod resource is created with a single container and sufficient resources, a Pod MUST be created on a node with the specified container image.
- id: pod/spec/basic-delete
  description: When a Pod resource is delete, the Pod containers must receive a TERM signal and the Pod MUST be deleted.
- id: pod/spec/hostname
  description: When the hostname field is set, a container running in the Pod MUST report the hostname as the specified value.
- id: pod/spec/subdomain
  description: If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be "<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod

    domainname at all.
- id: pod/spec/terminationGracePeriodSeconds/in-spec
  description: When the terminationGracePeriodSeconds is specified in the spec,
    processes running in the Pod MUST NOT receive a hard termination signal for at
    least that number of seconds after a delete request.
- id: pod/spec/terminationGracePeriodSeconds/in-delete
  description: When the terminationGracePeriodSeconds is specified in a delete request,
    processes running in the Pod MUST NOT receive a hard termination signal for at
    least that number of seconds after the delete request.
- id: pod/spec/activeDeadlineSeconds
  description: Optional duration in seconds the pod may be active on the node relative
    to StartTime before the system will actively try to mark it failed and kill
    associated containers. Value must be a positive integer.
- id: pod/spec/hostNetwork/true
  description: When hostNetwork is set to true, the Pod MUST use the host's network
    namespace.
- id: pod/spec/hostNetwork/false
  description: When hostNetwork is set to false, the Pod MUST NOT use the host's network
    namespace.
- id: pod/spec/hostPID/true
  description: When hostPID is set to true, the Pod MUST use the host's process
    namespace.
- id: pod/spec/hostPID/false
  description: When hostPID is set to false, the Pod MUST NOT use the host's process
    namespace.
- id: pod/spec/hostIPC/true
  description: When hostIPC is set to true, the Pod MUST use the host's inter-process
    communication namespace.
- id: pod/spec/hostIPC/false
  description: When hostIPC is set to false, the Pod MUST NOT use the host's inter-process
    communication namespace.
- id: pod/spec/label/create
  decription: Create a Pod with a unique label. Query for the Pod with the label as selector MUST be successful.
- id: pod/spec/label/patch
  decription: A patch request must be able to update the pod to change the value of an existing Label. Query for the Pod with the new value for the label MUST be successful.
- id: pod/spec/container/resources
