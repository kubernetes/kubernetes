# WARNING: Do not add tests in this directory

There are two types of end-to-end tests in Kubernetes:
 * [Cluster end-to-end tests](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/e2e-tests.md)
 * [Node end-to-end
   tests](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-node/e2e-node-tests.md)

Tests located in `${KUBE_ROOT}/test/e2e/common` are shared by both Cluster
and Node E2E test jobs. Tests in `${KUBE_ROOT}/test/e2e_node` are exclusively
owned by Node E2E. *If you want to add a test, most likely than not, you want
to add the test to one of the two directories mentioned above.* If you are
unsure, please check with the OWNER of the directory. This directory currently
contains misplaced and legacy tests; they will be cleaned up in the future.
