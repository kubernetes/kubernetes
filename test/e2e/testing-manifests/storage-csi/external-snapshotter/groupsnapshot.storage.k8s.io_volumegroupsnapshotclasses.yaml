          VolumeGroupSnapshotClass specifies parameters that a underlying storage system
          uses when creating a volume group snapshot. A specific VolumeGroupSnapshotClass
          is used by specifying its name in a VolumeGroupSnapshot object.
          VolumeGroupSnapshotClasses are non-namespaced.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

              through the VolumeGroupSnapshotClass should be deleted when its bound
              VolumeGroupSnapshot is deleted.
              Supported values are "Retain" and "Delete".
              "Retain" means that the VolumeGroupSnapshotContent and its physical group
              snapshot on underlying storage system are kept.
              "Delete" means that the VolumeGroupSnapshotContent and its physical group
              snapshot on underlying storage system are deleted.
              Required.
