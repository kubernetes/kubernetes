      # the set to help determine whether or not a cluster already exists.

      # directory to pass that information along to the primary container that
      # has to decide what command-line flags to use when starting CockroachDB.
      # This only matters when a pod's persistent volume is empty - if it has
      # data from a previous execution, that data will always be used.
