  # However, some of the helper packages can be useful
  # if they are written such that they:
  # - take a kubernetes.Interface as parameter instead of a Framework
  # - return errors instead of calling framework.Fail
  #
  # At least the following packages follow that approach.
  # More may be added as needed.
