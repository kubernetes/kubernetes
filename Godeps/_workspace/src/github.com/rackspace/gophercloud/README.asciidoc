== Gophercloud -- V0.1.0 image:https://secure.travis-ci.org/rackspace/gophercloud.png?branch=master["build status",link="https://travis-ci.org/rackspace/gophercloud"]

Gophercloud currently lets you authenticate with OpenStack providers to create and manage servers.
We are working on extending the API to further include cloud files, block storage, DNS, databases, security groups, and other features.

WARNING: This library is still in the very early stages of development. Unless you want to contribute, it probably isn't what you want.  Yet.

=== Outstanding Features

1.  Apache 2.0 License, making Gophercloud friendly to commercial and open-source enterprises alike.
2.  Gophercloud is one of the most actively maintained Go SDKs for OpenStack.
3.  Gophercloud supports Identity V2 and Nova V2 APIs.  More coming soon!
4.  The up-coming Gophercloud 0.2.0 release supports API extensions, and makes writing support for new extensions easy.
5.  Gophercloud supports automatic reauthentication upon auth token timeout, if enabled by your software.
6.  Gophercloud is the only SDK implementation with actual acceptance-level integration tests.

=== What Does it Look Like?

The Gophercloud 0.1.0 and earlier APIs are now deprecated and obsolete.
No new feature development will occur for 0.1.0 or 0.0.0.
However, we will accept and provide bug fixes for these APIs.
Please refer to the acceptance tests in the master brach for code examples using the v0.1.0 API.
The most up to date documentation for version 0.1.x can be found at link:http://godoc.org/github.com/rackspace/gophercloud[our Godoc.org documentation].

We are working on a new API that provides much better support for extensions, pagination, and other features that proved difficult to implement before.
This new API will be substantially more Go-idiomatic as well; one of the complaints received about 0.1.x and earlier is that it didn't "feel" right.
To see what this new API is going to look like, you can look at the code examples up on the link:http://gophercloud.io/docs.html[Gophercloud website].
If you're interested in tracking progress, note that features for version 0.2.0 will appear in the `v0.2.0` branch until merged to master.

=== How can I Contribute?

After using Gophercloud for a while, you might find that it lacks some useful feature, or that existing behavior seems buggy.  We welcome contributions
from our users for both missing functionality as well as for bug fixes.  We encourage contributors to collaborate with the
link:http://gophercloud.io/community.html[Gophercloud community.]

Finally, Gophercloud maintains its own link:http://gophercloud.io[announcements and updates blog.]
