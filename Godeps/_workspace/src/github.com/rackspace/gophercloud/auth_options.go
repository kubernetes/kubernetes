/*
AuthOptions stores information needed to authenticate to an OpenStack cluster.
You can populate one manually, or use a provider's AuthOptionsFromEnv() function
to read relevant information from the standard environment variables. Pass one
to a provider's AuthenticatedClient function to authenticate and obtain a
ProviderClient representing an active session on that provider.

Its fields are the union of those recognized by each identity implementation and
provider.
