// ConfigState houses the configuration options used by spew to format and
// display values.  There is a global instance, Config, that is used to control
// all top-level Formatter and Dump functionality.  Each ConfigState instance
// provides methods equivalent to the top-level functions.
//
// The zero value for ConfigState provides no indentation.  You would typically
// want to set it to a space or a tab.
//
// Alternatively, you can use NewDefaultConfig to get a ConfigState instance
// with default settings.  See the documentation of NewDefaultConfig for default
// values.

	// set this to a tab with "\t" or perhaps two spaces with "  ".

	// data structures.  The default, 0, means there is no limit.

	// nested data structures.

	// receiver when the current type is not a pointer.
	//
	// NOTE: This might be an unsafe action since calling one of these methods
	// with a pointer receiver could technically mutate the value, however,
	// in practice, types which choose to satisify an error or Stringer
	// interface with a pointer receiver should not be mutating their state
	// inside these interface methods.
	DisablePointerMethods bool

	// ContinueOnMethod specifies whether or not recursion should continue once
	// a custom error or Stringer interface is invoked.  The default, false,
	// means it will print the results of invoking the custom error or Stringer
	// interface and return immediately instead of continuing to recurse into
	// the internals of the data type.
	//
	// NOTE: This flag does not have any effect if method invocation is disabled
	// via the DisableMethods or DisablePointerMethods options.

	// this to have a more deterministic, diffable output.  Note that only
	// native types (bool, int, uint, floats, uintptr and string) and types
	// that support the error or Stringer interfaces (if methods are
	// enabled) are supported, with other types sorted according to the
	// reflect.Value.String() output which guarantees display stability.

/*
NewFormatter returns a custom formatter that satisfies the fmt.Formatter
interface.  As a result, it integrates cleanly with standard fmt package
printing functions.  The formatter is useful for inline printing of smaller data
types similar to the standard %v format specifier.

The custom formatter only responds to the %v (most compact), %+v (adds pointer
addresses), %#v (adds types), and %#+v (adds types and pointer addresses) verb
combinations.  Any other verbs such as %x and %q will be sent to the the
standard fmt package for formatting.  In addition, the custom formatter ignores
the width and precision arguments (however they will still work on the format
specifiers not handled by the custom formatter).

Typically this function shouldn't be called directly.  It is much easier to make
use of the custom formatter by calling one of the convenience functions such as
c.Printf, c.Println, or c.Printf.

Dump displays the passed parameters to standard out with newlines, customizable
indentation, and additional debug information such as complete types and all
pointer addresses used to indirect to the final value.  It provides the
following features over the built-in printing facilities provided by the fmt
package:

	* Pointers are dereferenced and followed
	* Circular data structures are detected and handled properly
	* Custom Stringer/error interfaces are optionally invoked, including
	  on unexported types
	* Custom types which only implement the Stringer/error interfaces via
	  a pointer receiver are optionally invoked when passing non-pointer
	  variables
	* Byte arrays and slices are dumped like the hexdump -C command which
	  includes offsets, byte values in hex, and ASCII output

The configuration options are controlled by modifying the public members
of c.  See ConfigState for options documentation.

See Fdump if you would prefer dumping to an arbitrary io.Writer or Sdump to
get the formatted result as a string.
