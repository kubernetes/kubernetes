### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report anonymous data to m.influxdb.com
# The data includes raft id (random 8 bytes), os, arch, version, and metadata.
# We don't track ip addresses of servers reporting. This is only used
# to track the number of instances running and the versions, which
# is very helpful for us.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.

### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata

### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
###

[data]
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/data"

  # Controls the storage engine used for new shards. Engines available are b1,
  # bz1, and tsm1. b1 was the original default engine from 0.9.0 to 0.9.2. bz1
  # has been the default engine since 0.9.3. tsm1 was introduced in 0.9.5 and is
  # currently EXPERIMENTAL. Consequently, data written into the tsm1 engine may
  # need to be wiped between upgrades.
  # engine ="bz1"

  # write or delete
  # compact-full-write-cold-duration = "24h"

### [hinted-handoff]
###
### Controls the hinted handoff feature, which allows nodes to temporarily
### store queued data when one node of a cluster is down for a short period
### of time.

  # interval will reset to retry-interval.
  retry-interval = "1s"
  retry-max-interval = "1m"

  # Interval between running checks for data that should be purged. Data is purged from
  # hinted-handoff queues for two reasons. 1) The data is older than the max age, or
  # 2) the target node has been dropped from the cluster. Data is never dropped until
  # it has reached max-age however, for a dropped node or not.
  purge-interval = "1h"

###
### [cluster]
###
### Controls non-Raft cluster behavior, which generally includes how data is
### shared across shards.
###

[cluster]
  shard-writer-timeout = "5s" # The time within which a remote shard must respond to a write request. 
  write-timeout = "10s" # The time within which a write request must complete on the cluster.

###
### [retention]
###
### Controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.
###

[retention]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "30m"

###
### [shard-precreation]
###
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are available before data arrives.
### Only shards that, after creation, will have both a start- and end-time in the
### future, will ever be created. Shards are never precreated that would be wholly
### or partially in the past.

[shard-precreation]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "10m"
  advance-period = "30m"

###
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
###
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.

[monitor]
  store-enabled = true # Whether to record statistics internally.

  store-interval = "10s" # The interval at which to record statistics

###
### [admin]
###
### Controls the availability of the built-in, web-based admin interface. If HTTPS is
### enabled for the admin interface, HTTPS must also be enabled on the [http] service.
###

[admin]
  enabled = true
  bind-address = ":8083"
  https-enabled = false
  https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"

###
### [http]
###
### Controls how the HTTP endpoints are configured. These are the primary
### mechanism for getting data into and out of InfluxDB.

  # otherwise you could get dropped metrics or poor performance. Batching
  # will buffer points in memory if you have many coming in.

  # batch-size = 1000 # will flush if this many points get buffered
  # batch-pending = 5 # number of batches that may be pending in memory
  # batch-timeout = "1s" # will flush at least this often even if we haven't hit buffer limit
  # udp-read-buffer = 0 # UDP Read buffer size, 0 means OS default. UDP listener will fail if set above OS max.

  ## "name-schema" configures tag names for parsing the metric name from graphite protocol;
  ## separated by `name-separator`.
  ## The "measurement" tag is special and the corresponding field will become
  ## the name of the metric.
  ## e.g. "type.host.measurement.device" will parse "server.localhost.cpu.cpu0" as
  ## {
  ##     measurement: "cpu",
  ##     tags: {
  ##         "type": "server",
  ##         "host": "localhost,
  ##         "device": "cpu0"
  ##     }
  ## }
  # name-schema = "type.host.measurement.device"

  ## If set to true, when the input metric name has more fields than `name-schema` specified,
  ## the extra fields will be ignored.
  ## Otherwise an error will be logged and the metric rejected.
  # ignore-unnamed = true
