// The kubelet binary is responsible for maintaining a set of containers on a particular host VM.
// It syncs data from both configuration file(s) as well as from a quorum of etcd servers.
// It then communicates with the container runtime (or a CRI shim for the runtime) to see what is
// currently running.  It synchronizes the configuration data, with the running set of containers
// by starting or stopping containers.
