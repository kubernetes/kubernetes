# This value determines how kubernetes binaries, config files, and service
# files are loaded onto the target machines.  The following are the only
# valid options:
#
# localBuild - requires make release to have been run to build local binaries
# packageManager - will install packages from your distribution using yum/dnf/apt
source_type: localBuild

# will be used as the Internal dns domain name if DNS is enabled. Services
# will be discoverable under <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.<domainname>, e.g.
# myservice.default.svc.cluster.local
cluster_name: cluster.local

# Account name of remote user. Ansible will use this user account to ssh into
# the managed machines. The user must be able to use sudo without asking
# for password unless ansible_sudo_pass is set
#ansible_ssh_user: root

# password for the ansible_ssh_user. If this is unset you will need to set up
# ssh keys so a password is not needed.
#ansible_ssh_pass: password

# If a password is needed to sudo to root that password must be set here
#ansible_sudo_pass: password

# A list of insecure registrys you night need to define
insecure_registrys:
#  - "gcr.io"

# If you need a proxy for the docker daemon define these here
#http_proxy: "http://proxy.example.com:3128"
#https_proxy: "http://proxy.example.com:3128"

# Kubernetes internal network for services.
# Kubernetes services will get fake IP addresses from this range.
# This range must not conflict with anything in your infrastructure. These
# addresses do not need to be routable and must just be an unused block of space.
kube_service_addresses: 10.254.0.0/16

# Flannel internal network (optional). When flannel is used, it will assign IP
# addresses from this range to individual pods.
# This network must be unused in your network infrastructure!
flannel_subnet: 172.16.0.0

# Flannel internal network total size (optional). This is the prefix of the
# entire flannel overlay network.  So the entirety of 172.16.0.0/12 must be
# unused in your environment.
flannel_prefix: 12

# Flannel internal network (optional). This is the size allocation that flannel
# will give to each node on your network.  With these defaults you should have
# room for 4096 nodes with 254 pods per node.
flannel_host_prefix: 24

# Set to false to disable logging with elasticsearch
cluster_logging: true

# Turn to false to disable cluster monitoring with heapster and influxdb
cluster_monitoring: true

# Turn this varable to 'false' to disable whole DNS configuration.
dns_setup: true
# How many replicas in the Replication Controller
dns_replicas: 1

# There are other variable in roles/kubernetes/defaults/main.yml but changing
# them comes with a much higher risk to your cluster. So proceed over there
# with caution.
