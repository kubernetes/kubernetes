# clone

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pvorb/node-clone.png)](http://travis-ci.org/pvorb/node-clone)

offers foolproof _deep cloning_ of variables in JavaScript.


## Installation

    npm install clone

or

    ender build clone


## Example

~~~ javascript
var clone = require('clone');

var a, b;

a = { foo: { bar: 'baz' } };  // initial value of a

b = clone(a);                 // clone a -> b
a.foo.bar = 'foo';            // change a

console.log(a);               // show a
console.log(b);               // show b
~~~

This will print:

~~~ javascript
{ foo: { bar: 'foo' } }
{ foo: { bar: 'baz' } }
~~~

**clone** masters cloning simple objects (even with custom prototype), arrays,
Date objects, and RegExp objects. Everything is cloned recursively, so that you
can clone dates in arrays in objects, for example.


## API

`clone(val, circular, depth)`

  * `val` -- the value that you want to clone, any type allowed
  * `circular` -- boolean

    Call `clone` with `circular` set to `false` if you are certain that `obj`
    contains no circular references. This will give better performance if needed.
    There is no error if `undefined` or `null` is passed as `obj`.
  * `depth` -- depth to which the object is to be cloned (optional,
    defaults to infinity)

`clone.clonePrototype(obj)`

  * `obj` -- the object that you want to clone

Does a prototype clone as
[described by Oran Looney](http://oranlooney.com/functional-javascript/).


## Circular References

~~~ javascript
var a, b;

a = { hello: 'world' };

a.myself = a;
b = clone(a);

console.log(b);
~~~

This will print:

~~~ javascript
{ hello: "world", myself: [Circular] }
~~~

So, `b.myself` points to `b`, not `a`. Neat!


## Test

    npm test


## Caveat

Some special objects like a socket or `process.stdout`/`stderr` are known to not
be cloneable. If you find other objects that cannot be cloned, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/pvorb/node-clone/issues/new).
