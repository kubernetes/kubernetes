See [livereload.com](http://livereload.com) for more info.\n\nTo use LiveReload, you need a client (this script) in your browser and a server running on your development machine.\n\nThis repository (livereload.js) implements the client side of the protocol. The client connects to a LiveReload server via web sockets and listens for incoming change notifications. When a CSS or an image file is modified, it is live-refreshed without reloading the page. When any other file is modified, the page is reloaded.\n\nThe server notifies the client whenever a change is made. Available servers are:\n\n* [LiveReload app for Mac](http://livereload.com/)\n* [rack-livereload](https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload)\n* [guard-livereload](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload)\n* [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)\n* more available on Google :-)\n* you can even write your own; refer to the [LiveReload protocol](http://help.livereload.com/kb/ecosystem/livereload-protocol)\n\nIf you are a web developer looking to _use_ LiveReload, you should refer to your LiveReload server/app/tool's documentation, rather that this repository. **You should use the copy of livereload.js script bundled with your server**, because it's guaranteed to be compatible, and may be customized for that server.\n\nMost LiveReload server vendors will serve livereload.js on the LiveReload port. When your server is running, you can typically access the script at `http://0.0.0.0:35729/livereload.js`.\n\nPlease read on *only* if you are:\n\n* using a server that doesn't document the usage of livereload.js\n* interested in hacking on livereload.js or want to understand it better\n* developing a LiveReload server\n\n\nWhat is livereload.js?\n----------------------\n\nThis repository contains a JavaScript file implementing the client side of the LiveReload protocol. It gets change notifications from a LiveReload server and applies them to the browser.\n\nIf you are **developing** a LiveReload server, see [dist/livereload.js](https://github.com/livereload/livereload-js/raw/master/dist/livereload.js) for the latest version built using the sources in this repository. We require LiveReload server vendors to distribute livereload.js as part of their apps or tools.\n\nAn old version of this script is also bundled with the LiveReload browser extensions, but it's not getting updated and only serves for compatibility with very old clients. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Live CSS reloading\n* Full page reloading\n* Protocol, WebSocket communication\n* CSS `@import` support\n* Live image reloading (`<img src=\"...\" />`, `background-image` and `border-image` properties, both inline and in stylesheets)\n* Live, in-browser LESS.js reloading\n\nWould love, but doesn't seem possible:\n\n* live JS reloading\n\n\nInstalling using Bower\n----------------------\n\nThis script is published on Bower. (But, to reiterate: the preferred method is to avoid installing it altogether, and instead use the one bundled with your LiveReload server/app/tool.)\n\nInstallation:\n\n    bower install livereload-js --save-dev\n\nThis gives you a component containing a single script file, `dist/livereload.js`.\n\n\nInstalling using npm and Browserify\n-----------------------------------\n\nIncluding livereload.js into your Browserify bundle probably makes no sense, because livereload.js isn't something you would ship to production.\n\nBut if you insist _and_ you know what you're doing, you can install LiveReload via npm:\n\n    npm install livereload-js --save\n\nand then add this to your bundle:\n\n    window.LiveReloadOptions = { host: 'localhost' };\n    require('livereload-js');\n\nNote that livereload-js package uses `window` and `document` globals, so won't run under Node.js environment.\n\nThe reason you need to specify `LiveReloadOptions` is that `livereload.js` won't be able to find its `<script>` tag and would normally bail out with an error message.\n\n\nUsing livereload.js\n-------------------\n\nThis script is meant to be included into the web pages you want to monitor, like this:\n\n    <script src=\"http://localhost:35729/livereload.js\"></script>\n\nLiveReload 2 server listens on port `35729` and serves livereload.js over HTTP (besides speaking the web socket protocol on the same port).\n\nA slightly smarter way is to use the host name of the current page, assuming that it is being served from the same computer. This approach enables LiveReload when viewing the web page from other devices on the network:\n\n```html\n<script>document.write('<script src=\"http://'\n    + location.host.split(':')[0]\n    + ':35729/livereload.js\"></'\n    + 'script>')</script>\n```\n\n\nHowever, since `location.host` is empty for `file:` URLs, we need to account for that:\n\n```html\n<script>document.write('<script src=\"http://'\n    + (location.host || 'localhost').split(':')[0]\n    + ':35729/livereload.js\"></'\n    + 'script>')</script>\n```\n\n\nLiveReload.js finds a `script` tag that includes `…/livereload.js` and uses it to determine the hostname/port to connect to. It also understands some options from the query string: `host`, `port`, `snipver`, `mindelay` and `maxdelay`.\n\n`snipver` specifies a version of the snippet, so that we can warn when the snippet needs to be updated. The currently recommended `snipver` is version 1:\n\n```html\n<script>document.write('<script src=\"http://'\n    + (location.host || 'localhost').split(':')[0]\n    + ':35729/livereload.js?snipver=1\"></'\n    + 'script>')</script>\n```\n\n\nAdditionally, you might want to specify `mindelay` and `maxdelay`, which is minimum and maximum reconnection delay in milliseconds (defaulting to `1000` and `60000`).\n\nAlternatively, instead of loading livereload.js from the LiveReload server, you might want to include it from a different URL. In this case, add a `host` parameter to override the host name. For example:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://github.com/livereload/livereload-js/raw/master/dist/livereload.js?host=localhost\"></script>\n```\n\n\nOptions\n-------\n\nOptions can either be specified as query parameters of the `<script src=\"..../livereload.js\">` tag's source URL, or as a global `window.LiveReloadOptions` dictionary. If the dictionary is specified, `livereload.js` does not even try looking for its `<script>` tag.\n\nThe set of supported options is the same for both methods:\n\n* `host`: the host that runs a LiveReload server; required if specifying `LiveReloadOptions`, otherwise will be autodetected as the origin of the `<script>` tag\n* `port`: optional server port override\n* `mindelay`, `maxdelay`: range of reconnection delays (if `livereload.js` cannot connect to the server, it will attempt to reconnect with increasing delays); defaults to 1,000 ms minimum and 60,000 ms maximum\n* `handshake_timeout`: timeout for a protocol handshake to be completed after a connection attempt; mostly only needed if you're running an interactive debugger on your web socket server\n\n\nIssues & Limitations\n--------------------\n\n**Serving livereload.js outside of the domain root.** Livereload.js expects to be served from the domain root (i.e. `http://myawesomeblog.com/livereload.js`). Serving from outside the domain root is possible, just add the `host` parameter to the `script` tag (see parameters documentation above). \n\n**Live reloading of imported stylesheets has a 200ms lag.** Modifying a CSS `@import` rule to reference a not-yet-cached file causes WebKit to lose all document styles, so we have to apply a workaround that causes a lag.\n\nOur workaround is to add a temporary `<link />` element for the imported stylesheet we're trying to reload, wait 200ms to make sure WebKit loads the new file, then remove `<link />` and recreate the `@import` rule. This prevents a flash of unstyled content. (We also wait 200 more milliseconds and recreate the `@import` rule again, in case those initial 200ms were not enough.)\n\n**Live image reloading is limited to `<img src=\"...\" />`, `background-image` and `border-image` styles.** Any other places where images can be mentioned?\n\n**Live image reloading is limited to `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, and `png` extensions.** Maybe need to add `svg` there? Anything else?\n\n\nCommunicating with livereload.js\n--------------------------------\n\nIt is possible to communicate with a running LiveReload script using DOM events:\n\n* fire `LiveReloadShutDown` event on `document` to make LiveReload disconnect and go away\n* listen for `LiveReloadConnect` event on `document` to learn when the connection is established\n* listen for `LiveReloadDisconnect` event on `document` to learn when the connection is interrupted (or fails to be established)\n\nThe `LiveReload` object is also exposed as `window.LiveReload`, with `LiveReload.disconnect()`, `LiveReload.connect()`, and `LiveReload.shutDown()` available. However, I'm not yet sure if I want to keep this API, so consider it non-contractual. (And please tell me if you have a use for it!)\n\n\nHaving trouble?\n---------------\n\nTo enable debugging output to console, append `?LR-verbose` to your URL.\n\n\nHacking on LiveReload.js\n------------------------\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Node.js with npm\n* Grunt (`npm install grunt-cli`)\n\nTo install additional prerequisites:\n\n    npm install\n\nTo build:\n\n    grunt build\n\nTo run tests:\n\n    grunt\n\nManual testing: open files in `test/html/*` in various browsers, make some changes and make sure they are applied.\n\nTesting the Browserify usage scenario: `grunt browserify:test`, then perform manual testing of `test/html/browserified/`.\n\n\nReleasing a new version\n-----------------------\n\n1. Update the version number in `package.json`.\n\n1. Run `rake version` to update the version numbers in all other files, using the one from `package.json`.\n\n1. Run `grunt`.\n\n1. Do some manual testing.\n\n1. Tag the version in Git: `rake tag` then `git push --tags`.\n\n1. `npm publish`\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nlivereload-js is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for details.\n\n\nVersion history\n---------------\n\n2.2.1 (Jan 17, 2015)\n\n* npm fix: actually include `/lib` in the package\n\n2.2.0 (Jan 16, 2015)\n\n* the first version stitched with Browserify; everything seems to work, but 2.1.0 is available just in case\n* switched the build system to Grunt\n\n2.1.0 (Jan 16, 2015)\n\n* use case-insensitive matching for `rel` attribute in `<link rel=\"stylesheet\">` tags, to accomodate legacy Rails versions\n* avoid usage of `console` when it's not definited\n* some README changes\n\n2.0.8 (May 22, 2012)\n\n* Fix live CSS refresh to work with prefixfree\n* Correctly trigger removal of old `<link>` tags\n\n(older history not recorded)\n",
