(Once only) Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and `npm` - useful instructions here: [https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814)\n\n    Make sure you have Node.js v 0.8 or higher.\n\n2. (Once only) Use `npm` to install `grunt-cli`\n\n        % npm install -g grunt-cli  # May need to be run as root\n\n3. (Every time you make a fresh checkout) Install dependencies (including `grunt`) for this project (run from project root)\n\n        % npm install\n\n4. Build using `grunt` (run from project root)\n\n        % grunt\n\n# Using the Audit API\n\n## Including the library\n\nThe simplest option is to include the generated `axs_testing.js` library on your page.\n\nWork is underway to include the library in WebDriver and other automated testing frameworks.\n\n## The `axs.Audit.run()` method\n\nOnce you have included `axs_testing.js`, you can call call `axs.Audit.run()`. This returns an object in the following form:\n\n    {\n      /** @type {axs.constants.AuditResult} */\n      result,  // one of PASS, FAIL or NA\n\n      /** @type {Array.<Element>} */\n      elements,  // The elements which the rule fails on, if result == axs.constants.AuditResult.FAIL\n\n      /** @type {axs.AuditRule} */\n      rule  // The rule which this result is for.\n    }\n\n### Command Line Runner\n\nThe Accessibility Developer Tools project includes a command line runner for the audit. To use the runner, [install phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) then run the following command from the project root directory.\n\n    $ phantomjs tools/runner/audit.js <url-or-filepath>\n\nThe runner will load the specified file or URL in a headless browser, inject axs_testing.js, run the audit and output the report text.\n\n## Using the results\n\n### Interpreting the result\n\nThe result may be one of three constants:\n* `axs.constants.AuditResult.PASS` - This implies that there were elements on the page that may potentially have failed this audit rule, but they passed. Congratulations!\n* `axs.constants.AuditResult.NA` - This implies that there were no elements on the page that may potentially have failed this audit rule. For example, an audit rule that checks video elements for subtitles would return this result if there were no video elements on the page.\n* `axs.constants.AuditResult.FAIL` - This implies that there were elements on the page that did not pass this audit rule. This is the only result you will probably be interested in.\n\n### Creating a useful error message\n\nThe static, global `axs.Audit.createReport(results, opt_url)` may be used to create an error message using the return value of axs.Audit.run(). This will look like the following:\n\n    *** Begin accessibility audit results ***\n    An accessibility audit found 4 errors and 4 warnings on this page.\n    For more information, please see https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools/wiki/Audit-Rules\n\n    Error: badAriaAttributeValue (AX_ARIA_04) failed on the following elements (1 - 3 of 3):\n    DIV:nth-of-type(3) > INPUT\n    DIV:nth-of-type(5) > INPUT\n    #aria-invalid\n\n    Error: badAriaRole (AX_ARIA_01) failed on the following element:\n    DIV:nth-of-type(11) > SPAN\n\n    Error: controlsWithoutLabel (AX_TEXT_01) failed on the following elements (1 - 3 of 3):\n    DIV > INPUT\n    DIV:nth-of-type(12) > DIV:nth-of-type(3) > INPUT\n    LABEL > INPUT\n\n    Error: requiredAriaAttributeMissing (AX_ARIA_03) failed on the following element:\n    DIV:nth-of-type(13) > DIV:nth-of-type(11) > DIV\n\n    Warning: focusableElementNotVisibleAndNotAriaHidden (AX_FOCUS_01) failed on the following element:\n    #notariahidden\n\n    Warning: imagesWithoutAltText (AX_TEXT_02) failed on the following elements (1 - 2 of 2):\n    #deceptive-img\n    DIV:nth-of-type(13) > IMG\n\n    Warning: lowContrastElements (AX_COLOR_01) failed on the following elements (1 - 2 of 2):\n    DIV:nth-of-type(13) > DIV\n    DIV:nth-of-type(13) > DIV:nth-of-type(3)\n\n    Warning: nonExistentAriaLabelledbyElement (AX_ARIA_02) failed on the following elements (1 - 2 of 2):\n    DIV:nth-of-type(3) > INPUT\n    DIV:nth-of-type(5) > INPUT\n    *** End accessibility audit results ***\n\nEach rule will have at most five elements listed as failures, in the form of a unique query selector for each element.\n\n### Configuring the Audit\n\nIf you wish to fine-tune the audit, you can create an `axs.AuditConfiguration` object, with the following options:\n\n#### Ignore parts of the page for a particular audit rule\n\nFor example, say you have a separate high-contrast version of your page, and there is a CSS rule which causes certain elements (with class `pretty`) on the page to be low-contrast for stylistic reasons. Running the audit unmodified produces results something like\n\n    Warning: lowContrastElements (AX_COLOR_01) failed on the following elements (1 - 5 of 15):\n    ...\n\nYou can modify the audit to ignore the elements which are known and intended to have low contrast like this:\n\n    var configuration = new axs.AuditConfiguration();\n    configuration.ignoreSelectors('lowContrastElements', '.pretty');\n    axs.Audit.run(configuration);\n\nThe `AuditConfiguration.ignoreSelectors()` method takes a rule name, which you can find in the audit report, and a query selector string representing the parts of the page to be ignored for that audit rule. Multiple calls to `ignoreSelectors()` can be made for each audit rule, if multiple selectors need to be ignored.\n\n#### Restrict the scope of the entire audit to a subsection of the page\n\nYou may have a part of the page which varies while other parts of the page stay constant, like a content area vs. a toolbar. In this case, running the audit on the entire page may give you spurious results in the part of the page which doesn't vary, which may drown out regressions in the main part of the page.\n\nYou can set a `scope` on the `AuditConfiguration` object like this:\n\n    var configuration = new axs.AuditConfiguration();\n    configuration.scope = document.querySelector('main');  // or however you wish to choose your scope element\n    axs.Audit.run(configuration);\n    \n## License\n\nCopyright 2013 Google Inc.
