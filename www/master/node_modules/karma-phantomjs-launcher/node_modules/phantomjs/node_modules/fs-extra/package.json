It is a drop in replacement for `fs`.\n\n\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nI got tired of including `mkdirp`, `rimraf`, and `cp -r` in most of my projects. \n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n    npm install --save fs-extra\n\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n`fs-extra` is a drop in replacement for native `fs`. All methods in `fs` are unmodified and attached to `fs-extra`.\n\nYou don't ever need to include the original `fs` module again:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs') //this is no longer necessary\n```\n\nyou can now do this:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs-extra') //var fs = require('fs')\n```\n\nor if you prefer to make it clear that you're using `fs-extra` and not `fs`, you may want \nto do this:\n\n```javascript\n//var fs = require('fs')\nvar fse = require('fs-extra')\n```\n\nyou can also keep both, but it's redundant:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs')\nvar fse = require('fs-extra')\n```\n\n\n\nMethods\n-------\n\n**NOTE:** You can still use the native Node.js methods. They are copied over to `fs-extra`.\n\n\n### copy(src, dest, [options], callback)\n\nCopy a file or directory. The directory can have contents. Like `cp -r`.\n\nSync: `copySync()`\n\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\n\nfs.copy('/tmp/myfile', '/tmp/mynewfile', function(err) {\n  if (err) return console.error(err)\n  console.log(\"success!\")\n}) //copies file\n\nfs.copy('/tmp/mydir', '/tmp/mynewdir', function(err) {\n  if (err) return console.error(err)\n  console.log(\"success!\")\n}) //copies directory, even if it has subdirectories or files\n```\n\n\n### ensureFile(file, callback) \n\nEnsures that the file exists. If the file that is requested to be created is in directories that do not exist, these directories are created. If the file already exists, it is **NOT MODIFIED**.\n\nAlias: `createFile()`\n\nSync: `createFileSync()`,`ensureFileSync()`\n\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\n\nvar file = '/tmp/this/path/does/not/exist/file.txt'\nfs.ensureFile(file, function(err) {\n  console.log(err) // => null\n  //file has now been created, including the directory it is to be placed in\n})\n```\n\n\n### ensureDir(dir, callback) \n\nEnsures that the directory exists. If the directory structure does not exist, it is created.\n\nSync: `ensureDirSync()`\n\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\n\nvar dir = '/tmp/this/path/does/not/exist'\nfs.ensureDir(dir, function(err) {\n  console.log(err) // => null\n  //dir has now been created, including the directory it is to be placed in\n})\n```\n\n\n\n### mkdirs(dir, callback) \n\nCreates a directory. If the parent hierarchy doesn't exist, it's created. Like `mkdir -p`.\n\nAlias: `mkdirp()`\n\nSync: `mkdirsSync()` / `mkdirpSync()`\n\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\n\nfs.mkdirs('/tmp/some/long/path/that/prob/doesnt/exist', function(err) {\n  if (err) return console.error(err)\n  console.log(\"success!\")\n})\n\nfs.mkdirsSync('/tmp/another/path')\n```\n\n\n### move(src, dest, [options], callback)\n\nMoves a file or directory, even across devices.\n\nOptions:  \nclobber (boolean): overwrite existing file or directory  \nlimit (number): number of concurrent moves, see ncp for more information\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\n\nfs.move('/tmp/somefile', '/tmp/does/not/exist/yet/somefile', function(err) {\n  if (err) return console.error(err)\n  console.log(\"success!\")\n})\n```\n\n\n### outputFile(file, data, callback)\n\nAlmost the same as `writeFile` (i.e. it [overwrites](http://pages.citebite.com/v2o5n8l2f5reb)), except that if the parent directory does not exist, it's created.\n\nSync: `outputFileSync()`\n\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\nvar file = '/tmp/this/path/does/not/exist/file.txt'\n\nfs.outputFile(file, 'hello!', function(err) {\n  console.log(err) // => null\n\n  fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', function(err, data) {\n    console.log(data) // => hello!\n  })\n})\n```\n\n\n\n### outputJson(file, data, callback)\n\nAlmost the same as `writeJson`, except that if the directory does not exist, it's created.\n\nAlias: `outputJSON()`\n\nSync: `outputJsonSync()`, `outputJSONSync()`\n\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\nvar file = '/tmp/this/path/does/not/exist/file.txt'\n\nfs.outputJson(file, {name: 'JP'}, function(err) {\n  console.log(err) // => null\n\n  fs.readJson(file, function(err, data) {\n    console.log(data.name) // => JP\n  })\n})\n```\n\n\n\n### readJson(file, [options], callback) \n\nReads a JSON file and then parses it into an object. `options` are the same that you'd pass to `fs.readFile`.\n\nAlias: `readJSON()`\n\nSync: `readJsonSync()`, `readJSONSync()`\n\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\n\nfs.readJson('./package.json', function(err, packageObj) {\n  console.log(packageObj.version) // => 0.1.3\n})\n```\n\n`readJsonSync()` can take a `throws` option set to `false` and it won't throw if the JSON is invalid. Example:\n\n```js\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\nvar file = path.join('/tmp/some-invalid.json')\nvar data = \"{not valid JSON\"\nfs.writeFileSync(file, data)\n\nvar obj = fs.readJsonSync(file, {throws: false})\nconsole.log(obj) // => null\n```\n\n\n### remove(dir, callback)\n\nRemoves a file or directory. The directory can have contents. Like `rm -rf`.\n\nAlias: `delete()`\n\nSync: `removeSync()` / `deleteSync()`\n\n\nExamples:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\n\nfs.remove('/tmp/myfile', function(err) {\n  if (err) return console.error(err)\n  \n  console.log(\"success!\")\n})\n\nfs.removeSync('/home/jprichardson') //I just deleted my entire HOME directory. \n```\n\n\n\n### writeJson(file, object, [options], callback) \n\nWrites an object to a JSON file. `options` are the same that you'd pass to `fs.readFile`.\n\nAlias: `writeJSON()`\n\nSync: `writeJsonSync()`, `writeJSONSync()`\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\nfs.writeJson('./package.json', {name: 'fs-extra'}, function(err) {\n  console.log(err)\n})\n```\n\n\nThird Party\n-----------\n\n### Promises\n\nUse [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird). See https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md#promisification. `fs-extra` is\nexplicitly listed as supported.\n\n```js\nvar Promise = require(\"bluebird\")\nvar fs = Promise.promisifyAll(require(\"fs-extra\"))\n```\n\nOr you can use the package [`fs-extra-promise`](https://github.com/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise) that marries the two together.\n\n\n### TypeScript\n\nIf you like TypeScript, you can use `fs-extra` with it: https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/fs-extra\n\n\n### File / Directory Watching\n\nIf you want to watch for changes to files or directories, then you should use [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar).\n\n\n### Misc.\n\n- [mfs](https://github.com/cadorn/mfs) - Monitor your fs-extra calls.\n\n\n\n\nNaming\n------\n\nI put a lot of thought into the naming of these functions. Inspired by @coolaj86's request. So he deserves much of the credit for raising the issue. See discussion(s) here:\n\n* https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/2\n* https://github.com/flatiron/utile/issues/11\n* https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/wrench-js/issues/29\n* https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/issues/17\n\nFirst, I believe that in as many cases as possible, the [Node.js naming schemes](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) should be chosen. However, there are problems with the Node.js own naming schemes.\n\nFor example, `fs.readFile()` and `fs.readdir()`: the **F** is capitalized in *File* and the **d** is not capitalized in *dir*. Perhaps a bit pedantic, but they should still be consistent. Also, Node.js has chosen a lot of POSIX naming schemes, which I believe is great. See: `fs.mkdir()`, `fs.rmdir()`, `fs.chown()`, etc.\n\nWe have a dilemma though. How do you consistently name methods that perform the following POSIX commands: `cp`, `cp -r`, `mkdir -p`, and `rm -rf`?\n\nMy perspective: when in doubt, err on the side of simplicity. A directory is just a hierarchical grouping of directories and files. Consider that for a moment. So when you want to copy it or remove it, in most cases you'll want to copy or remove all of its contents. When you want to create a directory, if the directory that it's suppose to be contained in does not exist, then in most cases you'll want to create that too. \n\nSo, if you want to remove a file or a directory regardless of whether it has contents, just call `fs.remove(path)` or its alias `fs.delete(path)`. If you want to copy a file or a directory whether it has contents, just call `fs.copy(source, destination)`. If you want to create a directory regardless of whether its parent directories exist, just call `fs.mkdirs(path)` or `fs.mkdirp(path)`. \n\n\nCredit\n------\n\n`fs-extra` wouldn't be possible without using the modules from the following authors:\n\n- [Isaac Shlueter](https://github.com/isaacs)\n- [Charlie McConnel](https://github.com/avianflu)\n- [James Halliday](https://github.com/substack)\n- [Andrew Kelley](https://github.com/andrewrk)\n\n\nContributions\n-------------\n\nIf you want to contribute, please add a test.
