Any further requests to open a file are put in a\n  queue until new slots become available. If 1024 turns out to be too\n  much, it decreases the limit further.\n* fixes `lchmod` for Node versions prior to 0.6.2.\n* implements `fs.lutimes` if possible. Otherwise it becomes a noop.\n* ignores `EINVAL` and `EPERM` errors in `chown`, `fchown` or\n  `lchown` if the user isn't root.\n* makes `lchmod` and `lchown` become noops, if not available.\n* retries reading a file if `read` results in EAGAIN error.\n\nOn Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if `EACCESS`\nor `EPERM` error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked\nthe directory.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe maximum number of open file descriptors that graceful-fs manages may\nbe adjusted by setting `fs.MAX_OPEN` to a different number. The default\nis 1024.\n",
