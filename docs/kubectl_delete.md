## kubectl delete

Delete a resource by filename, stdin, resource and ID, or by resources and label selector.

### Synopsis


Delete a resource by filename, stdin, resource and ID, or by resources and label selector.

JSON and YAML formats are accepted.

If both a filename and command line arguments are passed, the command line
arguments are used and the filename is ignored.

Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone
submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their update
will be lost along with the rest of the resource.

```
kubectl delete ([-f FILENAME] | (RESOURCE [(ID | -l label | --all)]
```

### Examples

```
// Delete a pod using the type and ID specified in pod.json.
$ kubectl delete -f pod.json

// Delete a pod based on the type and ID in the JSON passed into stdin.
$ cat pod.json | kubectl delete -f -

// Delete pods and services with label name=myLabel.
$ kubectl delete pods,services -l name=myLabel

// Delete a pod with ID 1234-56-7890-234234-456456.
$ kubectl delete pod 1234-56-7890-234234-456456

// Delete all pods
$ kubectl delete pods --all
```

### Options

```
      --all=false: [-all] to select all the specified resources
      --cascade=true: If true, cascade the delete resources managed by this resource (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController).  Default true.
  -f, --filename=[]: Filename, directory, or URL to a file containing the resource to delete
      --grace-period=-1: Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative.
  -h, --help=false: help for delete
  -l, --selector="": Selector (label query) to filter on
```
