description: |-
  Set a new size for a Deployment, ReplicaSet, Replication Controller, or Job.

  Scale also allows users to specify one or more preconditions for the scale action.
  If --current-replicas or --resource-version is specified, it is validated before the
  scale is attempted, and it is guaranteed that the precondition holds true when the
  scale is sent to the server.
options:
- name: current-replicas
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    Precondition for current size. Requires that the current size of the resource match this value in order to scale.
- name: filename
  shorthand: f
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Filename, directory, or URL to a file identifying the resource to set a new size
- name: include-extended-apis
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, include definitions of new APIs via calls to the API server. [default true]
- name: output
  shorthand: o
  usage: |
    Output mode. Use "-o name" for shorter output (resource/name).
- name: record
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation.
- name: recursive
  shorthand: R
  default_value: "false"
  usage: If true, process directory recursively.
- name: replicas
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: The new desired number of replicas. Required.
- name: resource-version
  usage: |
    Precondition for resource version. Requires that the current resource version match this value in order to scale.
- name: timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a scale operation, zero means don't wait.
inherited_options:
- name: alsologtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error as well as files
- name: api-version
  usage: |
    DEPRECATED: The API version to use when talking to the server
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation.
- name: certificate-authority
  usage: Path to a cert. file for the certificate authority.
- name: client-certificate
  usage: Path to a client certificate file for TLS.
- name: client-key
  usage: Path to a client key file for TLS.
- name: cluster
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure.
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: log-backtrace-at
  default_value: :0
  usage: when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
- name: log-dir
  usage: If non-empty, write log files in this directory
- name: log-flush-frequency
  default_value: 5s
  usage: Maximum number of seconds between log flushes
- name: logtostderr
  default_value: "true"
  usage: log to standard error instead of files
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace
  usage: If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request.
- name: password
  usage: Password for basic authentication to the API server.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: stderrthreshold
  default_value: "2"
  usage: logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server.
- name: user
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig user to use
- name: username
  usage: Username for basic authentication to the API server.
- name: v
  default_value: "0"
  usage: log level for V logs
- name: vmodule
  usage: |
    comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
example: |-
  # Scale a replicaset named 'foo' to 3.
  kubectl scale --replicas=3 rs/foo

  # Scale a resource identified by type and name specified in "foo.yaml" to 3.
  kubectl scale --replicas=3 -f foo.yaml

  # If the deployment named mysql's current size is 2, scale mysql to 3.
  kubectl scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=3 deployment/mysql

  # Scale multiple replication controllers.
  kubectl scale --replicas=5 rc/foo rc/bar rc/baz

  # Scale job named 'cron' to 3.
  kubectl scale --replicas=3 job/cron
