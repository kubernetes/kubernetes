name: scale
synopsis: |
  Set a new size for a Deployment, ReplicaSet, Replication Controller, or Job
description: "Set a new size for a Deployment, ReplicaSet, Replication Controller,
  or Job. \n\nScale also allows users to specify one or more preconditions for the
  scale action. \n\nIf --current-replicas or --resource-version is specified, it is
  validated before the scale is attempted, and it is guaranteed that the precondition
  holds true when the scale is sent to the server."
options:
- name: current-replicas
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    Precondition for current size. Requires that the current size of the resource match this value in order to scale.
- name: filename
  shorthand: f
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to set a new size
- name: include-extended-apis
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, include definitions of new APIs via calls to the API server. [default true]
- name: output
  shorthand: o
  usage: |
    Output mode. Use "-o name" for shorter output (resource/name).
- name: record
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
- name: recursive
  shorthand: R
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
- name: replicas
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: The new desired number of replicas. Required.
- name: resource-version
  usage: |
    Precondition for resource version. Requires that the current resource version match this value in order to scale.
- name: timeout
  default_value: 0s
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a scale operation, zero means don't wait. Any other values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h).
inherited_options:
- name: alsologtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error as well as files
- name: api-version
  usage: |
    DEPRECATED: The API version to use when talking to the server
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation
- name: certificate-authority
  usage: Path to a cert. file for the certificate authority
- name: client-certificate
  usage: Path to a client certificate file for TLS
- name: client-key
  usage: Path to a client key file for TLS
- name: cluster
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: log-backtrace-at
  default_value: :0
  usage: when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
- name: log-dir
  usage: If non-empty, write log files in this directory
- name: logtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error instead of files
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace
  shorthand: "n"
  usage: If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
- name: password
  usage: Password for basic authentication to the API server
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: stderrthreshold
  default_value: "2"
  usage: logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server
- name: user
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig user to use
- name: username
  usage: Username for basic authentication to the API server
- name: v
  shorthand: v
  default_value: "0"
  usage: log level for V logs
- name: vmodule
  usage: |
    comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
example: "  # Scale a replicaset named 'foo' to 3.\n  kubectl scale --replicas=3 rs/foo\n
  \ \n  # Scale a resource identified by type and name specified in \"foo.yaml\" to
  3.\n  kubectl scale --replicas=3 -f foo.yaml\n  \n  # If the deployment named mysql's
  current size is 2, scale mysql to 3.\n  kubectl scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=3
  deployment/mysql\n  \n  # Scale multiple replication controllers.\n  kubectl scale
  --replicas=5 rc/foo rc/bar rc/baz\n  \n  # Scale job named 'cron' to 3.\n  kubectl
  scale --replicas=3 job/cron"
