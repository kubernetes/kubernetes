synopsis: Apply a configuration to a resource by filename or stdin
description: "Apply a configuration to a resource by filename or stdin. This resource
  will be created if it doesn't exist yet. To use 'apply', always create the resource
  initially with either 'apply' or 'create --save-config'. \n\nJSON and YAML formats
  are accepted. \n\nAlpha Disclaimer: the --prune functionality is not yet complete.
  Do not use unless you are aware of what the current state is. See https://issues.k8s.io/34274."
