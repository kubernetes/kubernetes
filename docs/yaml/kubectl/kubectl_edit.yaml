synopsis: Edit a resource on the server
description: "Edit a resource from the default editor. \n\nThe edit command allows
  you to directly edit any API resource you can retrieve via the command line tools.
  It will open the editor defined by your KUBE _EDITOR, or EDITOR environment variables,
  or fall back to 'vi' for Linux or 'notepad' for Windows. You can edit multiple objects,
  although changes are applied one at a time. The command accepts filenames as well
  as command line arguments, although the files you point to must be previously saved
  versions of resources. \n\nEditing is done with the API version used to fetch the
  resource. To edit using a specific API version, fully-qualify the resource, version,
  and group. \n\nThe default format is YAML. To edit in JSON, specify \"-o json\".
  \n\nThe flag --windows-line-endings can be used to force Windows line endings, otherwise
  the default for your operating system will be used. \n\nIn the event an error occurs
  while updating, a temporary file will be created on disk that contains your unapplied
  changes. The most common error when updating a resource is another editor changing
  the resource on the server. When this occurs, you will have to apply your changes
  to the newer version of the resource, or update your temporary saved copy to include
  the latest resource version."
options:
- name: filename
  shorthand: f

  usage: |
    Filename, directory, or URL to files to use to edit the resource

- name: logtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error instead of files
- name: match-server-version

- name: password
  usage: Password for basic authentication to the API server
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
