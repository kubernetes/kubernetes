synopsis: Edit a resource on the server
description: |-
  Edit a resource from the default editor.

  The edit command allows you to directly edit any API resource you can retrieve via the
  command line tools. It will open the editor defined by your KUBE_EDITOR, or EDITOR
  environment variables, or fall back to 'vi' for Linux or 'notepad' for Windows.
  You can edit multiple objects, although changes are applied one at a time. The command
  accepts filenames as well as command line arguments, although the files you point to must
  be previously saved versions of resources.

  The files to edit will be output in the default API version, or a version specified
  by --output-version. The default format is YAML - if you would like to edit in JSON
  pass -o json. The flag --windows-line-endings can be used to force Windows line endings,
  otherwise the default for your operating system will be used.

  In the event an error occurs while updating, a temporary file will be created on disk
  that contains your unapplied changes. The most common error when updating a resource
  is another editor changing the resource on the server. When this occurs, you will have
  to apply your changes to the newer version of the resource, or update your temporary
  saved copy to include the latest resource version.
