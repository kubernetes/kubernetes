name: expose
synopsis: |
  Take a replication controller, service, deployment or pod and expose it as a new Kubernetes Service
description: "Expose a resource as a new Kubernetes service. \n\nLooks up a deployment,
  service, replica set, replication controller or pod by name and uses the selector
  for that resource as the selector for a new service on the specified port. A deployment
  or replica set will be exposed as a service only if its selector is convertible
  to a selector that service supports, i.e. when the selector contains only the matchLabels
  component. Note that if no port is specified via --port and the exposed resource
  has multiple ports, all will be re-used by the new service. Also if no labels are
  specified, the new service will re-use the labels from the resource it exposes.
  \n\nPossible resources include (case insensitive): \n\npod (po), service (svc),
  replicationcontroller (rc), deployment (deploy), replicaset (rs)"
options:
- name: allow-missing-template-keys
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
- name: cluster-ip
  usage: |
    ClusterIP to be assigned to the service. Leave empty to auto-allocate, or set to 'None' to create a headless service.
- name: container-port
  usage: Synonym for --target-port
- name: dry-run
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it.

  shorthand: f
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to expose a service
- name: generator
  default_value: service/v2
  usage: |
    The name of the API generator to use. There are 2 generators: 'service/v1' and 'service/v2'. The only difference between them is that service port in v1 is named 'default', while it is left unnamed in v2. Default is 'service/v2'.
- name: labels
  shorthand: l
  usage: Labels to apply to the service created by this call.
- name: load-balancer-ip
  usage: |
    IP to assign to the Load Balancer. If empty, an ephemeral IP will be created and used (cloud-provider specific).
- name: name
  usage: The name for the newly created object.
- name: no-headers

  usage: |
    When using the default or custom-column output format, don't print headers (default print headers).
- name: output
  shorthand: o
  usage: |
    Output format. One of: json|yaml|wide|name|custom-columns=...|custom-columns-file=...|go-template=...|go-template-file=...|jsonpath=...|jsonpath-file=... See custom columns [http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/#custom-columns], golang template [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview] and jsonpath template [http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/jsonpath].
- name: output-version
  usage: |
    DEPRECATED: To use a specific API version, fully-qualify the resource, version, and group (for example: 'jobs.v1.batch/myjob').
- name: overrides
  usage: |
    An inline JSON override for the generated object. If this is non-empty, it is used to override the generated object. Requires that the object supply a valid apiVersion field.
- name: port
  usage: |
    The port that the service should serve on. Copied from the resource being exposed, if unspecified

  usage: |
    The network protocol for the service to be created. Default is 'TCP'.
- name: record
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
- name: recursive
  shorthand: R
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
- name: save-config
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. This is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
- name: selector
  usage: |
    A label selector to use for this service. Only equality-based selector requirements are supported. If empty (the default) infer the selector from the replication controller or replica set.
- name: session-affinity
  usage: |
    If non-empty, set the session affinity for the service to this; legal values: 'None', 'ClientIP'
- name: show-all
  shorthand: a
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    When printing, show all resources (default hide terminated pods.)
- name: show-labels
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    When printing, show all labels as the last column (default hide labels column)
- name: sort-by
  usage: |
    If non-empty, sort list types using this field specification.  The field specification is expressed as a JSONPath expression (e.g. '{.metadata.name}'). The field in the API resource specified by this JSONPath expression must be an integer or a string.
- name: target-port
  usage: |
    Name or number for the port on the container that the service should direct traffic to. Optional.
- name: template
  usage: |
    Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
