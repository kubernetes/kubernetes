synopsis: Show details of a specific resource or group of resources
description: "Show details of a specific resource or group of resources. This command
  joins many API calls together to form a detailed description of a given resource
  or group of resources. \n\n  $ kubectl describe TYPE NAME_PREFIX\n  \nwill first
  check for an exact match on TYPE and NAME PREFIX. If no such resource exists, it
  will output details for every resource that has a name prefixed with NAME PREFIX.

- name: password
  usage: Password for basic authentication to the API server
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
