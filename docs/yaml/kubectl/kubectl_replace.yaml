synopsis: Replace a resource by filename or stdin
description: "Replace a resource by filename or stdin. \n\nJSON and YAML formats are
  accepted. If replacing an existing resource, the complete resource spec must be
  provided. This can be obtained by \n\n  $ kubectl get TYPE NAME -o yaml\n  \nPlease
  refer to the models in https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/HEAD/docs/api-reference/v1/definitions.html
  to find if a field is mutable."
options:
- name: cascade
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Only relevant during a force replace. If true, cascade the deletion of the resources managed by this resource (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController).
- name: filename
  shorthand: f
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Filename, directory, or URL to files to use to replace the resource.
- name: force
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Delete and re-create the specified resource
- name: grace-period
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    Only relevant during a force replace. Period of time in seconds given to the old resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative.
- name: include-extended-apis
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, include definitions of new APIs via calls to the API server. [default true]
- name: output
  shorthand: o
  usage: |
    Output mode. Use "-o name" for shorter output (resource/name).
- name: record
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
- name: recursive
  shorthand: R
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
- name: save-config
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. This is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
- name: schema-cache-dir
  default_value: ~/.kube/schema
  usage: |
    If non-empty, load/store cached API schemas in this directory, default is '$HOME/.kube/schema'
- name: timeout
  default_value: 0s
  usage: |
    Only relevant during a force replace. The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete of the old resource, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the object. Any other values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h).
- name: validate
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, use a schema to validate the input before sending it
inherited_options:
- name: alsologtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error as well as files
- name: api-version
  usage: |
    DEPRECATED: The API version to use when talking to the server
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation
- name: certificate-authority

- name: cluster
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: log-backtrace-at
  default_value: :0
  usage: when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
- name: log-dir
  usage: If non-empty, write log files in this directory
- name: logtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error instead of files
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace
  shorthand: "n"
  usage: If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
- name: password
  usage: Password for basic authentication to the API server
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: stderrthreshold
  default_value: "2"
  usage: logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server
- name: user
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig user to use
- name: username
  usage: Username for basic authentication to the API server
- name: v
  shorthand: v
  default_value: "0"
  usage: log level for V logs
- name: vmodule
  usage: |
    comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
example: "  # Replace a pod using the data in pod.json.\n  kubectl replace -f ./pod.json\n
  \ \n  # Replace a pod based on the JSON passed into stdin.\n  cat pod.json | kubectl
  replace -f -\n  \n  # Update a single-container pod's image version (tag) to v4\n
  \ kubectl get pod mypod -o yaml | sed 's/\\(image: myimage\\):.*$/\\1:v4/' | kubectl
  replace -f -\n  \n  # Force replace, delete and then re-create the resource\n  kubectl
  replace --force -f ./pod.json"
