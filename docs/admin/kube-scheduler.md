## kube-scheduler



### Synopsis


The Kubernetes scheduler is a policy-rich, topology-aware,
workload-specific function that significantly impacts availability, performance,
and capacity. The scheduler needs to take into account individual and collective
resource requirements, quality of service requirements, hardware/software/policy
constraints, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, inter-workload
interference, deadlines, and so on. Workload-specific requirements will be exposed
through the API as necessary.

```
kube-scheduler
```

### Options

```
      --address="0.0.0.0": The IP address to serve on (set to 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces)
      --algorithm-provider="DefaultProvider": The scheduling algorithm provider to use, one of: DefaultProvider
      --failure-domains="kubernetes.io/hostname,failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone,failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region": Indicate the "all topologies" set for an empty topologyKey when it's used for PreferredDuringScheduling pod anti-affinity.
      --google-json-key="": The Google Cloud Platform Service Account JSON Key to use for authentication.
      --hard-pod-affinity-symmetric-weight=1: RequiredDuringScheduling affinity is not symmetric, but there is an implicit PreferredDuringScheduling affinity rule corresponding to every RequiredDuringScheduling affinity rule. --hard-pod-affinity-symmetric-weight represents the weight of implicit PreferredDuringScheduling affinity rule.
      --kube-api-burst=100: Burst to use while talking with kubernetes apiserver
      --kube-api-content-type="": ContentType of requests sent to apiserver. Passing application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf is an experimental feature now.
      --kube-api-qps=50: QPS to use while talking with kubernetes apiserver
      --kubeconfig="": Path to kubeconfig file with authorization and master location information.
      --leader-elect[=false]: Start a leader election client and gain leadership before executing the main loop. Enable this when running replicated components for high availability.
      --leader-elect-lease-duration=15s: The duration that non-leader candidates will wait after observing a leadership renewal until attempting to acquire leadership of a led but unrenewed leader slot. This is effectively the maximum duration that a leader can be stopped before it is replaced by another candidate. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled.
      --leader-elect-renew-deadline=10s: The interval between attempts by the acting master to renew a leadership slot before it stops leading. This must be less than or equal to the lease duration. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled.
      --leader-elect-retry-period=2s: The duration the clients should wait between attempting acquisition and renewal of a leadership. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled.
      --log-flush-frequency=5s: Maximum number of seconds between log flushes
      --master="": The address of the Kubernetes API server (overrides any value in kubeconfig)
      --policy-config-file="": File with scheduler policy configuration
      --port=10251: The port that the scheduler's http service runs on
      --profiling[=true]: Enable profiling via web interface host:port/debug/pprof/
      --scheduler-name="default-scheduler": Name of the scheduler, used to select which pods will be processed by this scheduler, based on pod's annotation with key 'scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/name'
```
