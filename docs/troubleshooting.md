# Troubleshooting
Sometimes things go wrong.  This guide is aimed at making them right.  It has two sections:
   * [Troubleshooting your application](application-troubleshooting.md) - Useful for users who are deploying code into Kubernetes and wondering why it is not working.
   * [Troubleshooting your cluster](cluster-troubleshooting) - Useful for cluster adminstrators and people whose Kubernetes cluster is unhappy.
