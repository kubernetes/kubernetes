# Troubleshooting

Sometimes things go wrong.  This guide is aimed at making them right.  It has two sections:
   * [Troubleshooting your application](user-guide/application-troubleshooting.md) - Useful for users who are deploying code into Kubernetes and wondering why it is not working.
   * [Troubleshooting your cluster](admin/cluster-troubleshooting.md) - Useful for cluster administrators and people whose Kubernetes cluster is unhappy.

You should also check the [known issues](user-guide/known-issues.md) for the release you're using.
