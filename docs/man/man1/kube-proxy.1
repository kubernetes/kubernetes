.SH NAME
.PP
kube\-proxy \- Provides network proxy services.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkube\-proxy\fP [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBkubernetes\fP network proxy runs on each node. This reflects services as defined in the Kubernetes API on each node and can do simple TCP stream forwarding or round robin TCP forwarding across a set of backends. Service endpoints are currently found through Docker\-links\-compatible environment variables specifying ports opened by the service proxy. Currently the user must select a port to expose the service on on the proxy, as well as the container's port to target.

.PP
The kube\-proxy takes several options.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-alsologtostderr\fP=false
    log to standard error as well as files

.PP
\fB\-api\_version=\fP""
    The API version to use when talking to the server

.PP
\fB\-bindaddress\fP="0.0.0.0"

.PP
\fB\-configfile\fP="/tmp/proxy\_config"
    Configuration file for the proxy

.PP
\fB\-etcd\_servers\fP=[]

\[la]http://ip:port\[ra]), comma separated (optional)

.PP
\fB\-insecure\_skip\_tls\_verify\fP=false
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure.

.PP

    when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace

.PP
\fB\-log\_dir\fP=""
    If non\-empty, write log files in this directory

.PP
\fB\-log\_flush\_frequency\fP=5s
    Maximum number of seconds between log flushes

.PP

.PP

    The address of the Kubernetes API server

.PP
\fB\-stderrthreshold\fP=0
