kube\-scheduler \-


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkube\-scheduler\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Kubernetes scheduler is a policy\-rich, topology\-aware,
workload\-specific function that significantly impacts availability, performance,
and capacity. The scheduler needs to take into account individual and collective
resource requirements, quality of service requirements, hardware/software/policy
constraints, affinity and anti\-affinity specifications, data locality, inter\-workload
interference, deadlines, and so on. Workload\-specific requirements will be exposed
through the API as necessary.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-\-address\fP="0.0.0.0"
    The IP address to serve on (set to 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces)

.PP
\fB\-\-algorithm\-provider\fP="DefaultProvider"
    The scheduling algorithm provider to use, one of: ClusterAutoscalerProvider | DefaultProvider

.PP
\fB\-\-azure\-container\-registry\-config\fP=""
    Path to the file container Azure container registry configuration information.

.PP
\fB\-\-contention\-profiling\fP=false
    Enable lock contention profiling, if profiling is enabled

.PP
\fB\-\-failure\-domains\fP="kubernetes.io/hostname,failure\-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone,failure\-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region"
    Indicate the "all topologies" set for an empty topologyKey when it's used for PreferredDuringScheduling pod anti\-affinity.

.PP
\fB\-\-feature\-gates\fP=
    A set of key=value pairs that describe feature gates for alpha/experimental features. Options are:
Accelerators=true|false (ALPHA \- default=false)
AffinityInAnnotations=true|false (ALPHA \- default=false)
AllAlpha=true|false (ALPHA \- default=false)
AllowExtTrafficLocalEndpoints=true|false (BETA \- default=true)
AppArmor=true|false (BETA \- default=true)
DynamicKubeletConfig=true|false (ALPHA \- default=false)
DynamicVolumeProvisioning=true|false (ALPHA \- default=true)
ExperimentalCriticalPodAnnotation=true|false (ALPHA \- default=false)
ExperimentalHostUserNamespaceDefaulting=true|false (BETA \- default=false)
StreamingProxyRedirects=true|false (BETA \- default=true)
TaintBasedEvictions=true|false (ALPHA \- default=false)

.PP
\fB\-\-google\-json\-key\fP=""
    The Google Cloud Platform Service Account JSON Key to use for authentication.

.PP
\fB\-\-hard\-pod\-affinity\-symmetric\-weight\fP=1
    RequiredDuringScheduling affinity is not symmetric, but there is an implicit PreferredDuringScheduling affinity rule corresponding to every RequiredDuringScheduling affinity rule. \-\-hard\-pod\-affinity\-symmetric\-weight represents the weight of implicit PreferredDuringScheduling affinity rule.

.PP
\fB\-\-kube\-api\-burst\fP=100
    Burst to use while talking with kubernetes apiserver

.PP
\fB\-\-kube\-api\-content\-type\fP="application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf"
    Content type of requests sent to apiserver.

.PP
\fB\-\-kube\-api\-qps\fP=50
    QPS to use while talking with kubernetes apiserver

.PP
\fB\-\-kubeconfig\fP=""
    Path to kubeconfig file with authorization and master location information.

.PP
\fB\-\-leader\-elect\fP=true
    Start a leader election client and gain leadership before executing the main loop. Enable this when running replicated components for high availability.

.PP
\fB\-\-leader\-elect\-lease\-duration\fP=15s
    The duration that non\-leader candidates will wait after observing a leadership renewal until attempting to acquire leadership of a led but unrenewed leader slot. This is effectively the maximum duration that a leader can be stopped before it is replaced by another candidate. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled.

.PP
\fB\-\-leader\-elect\-renew\-deadline\fP=10s
    The interval between attempts by the acting master to renew a leadership slot before it stops leading. This must be less than or equal to the lease duration. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled.

.PP
\fB\-\-leader\-elect\-retry\-period\fP=2s
    The duration the clients should wait between attempting acquisition and renewal of a leadership. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled.

.PP
\fB\-\-lock\-object\-name\fP="kube\-scheduler"
    Define the name of the lock object.

.PP
\fB\-\-lock\-object\-namespace\fP="kube\-system"
    Define the namespace of the lock object.

.PP
\fB\-\-master\fP=""
    The address of the Kubernetes API server (overrides any value in kubeconfig)

.PP
\fB\-\-policy\-config\-file\fP=""
    File with scheduler policy configuration. This file is used if policy ConfigMap is not provided or \-\-use\-legacy\-policy\-config==true

.PP
\fB\-\-policy\-configmap\fP=""
    Name of the ConfigMap object that contains scheduler's policy configuration. It must exist in the system namespace before scheduler initialization if \-\-use\-legacy\-policy\-config==false. The config must be provided as the value of an element in 'Data' map with the key='policy.cfg'

.PP
\fB\-\-policy\-configmap\-namespace\fP="kube\-system"
    The namespace where policy ConfigMap is located. The system namespace will be used if this is not provided or is empty.

.PP
\fB\-\-port\fP=10251
    The port that the scheduler's http service runs on

.PP
\fB\-\-profiling\fP=true
    Enable profiling via web interface host:port/debug/pprof/

.PP
\fB\-\-scheduler\-name\fP="default\-scheduler"
    Name of the scheduler, used to select which pods will be processed by this scheduler, based on pod's "spec.SchedulerName".

.PP
\fB\-\-use\-legacy\-policy\-config\fP=false
    When set to true, scheduler will ignore policy ConfigMap and uses policy config file
