## 2.5.0

### Ginkgo output now includes a timeline-view of the spec

This commit changes Ginkgo's default output.  Spec details are now
presented as a **timeline** that includes events that occur during the spec
lifecycle interleaved with any GinkgoWriter content.  This makes is much easier
to understand the flow of a spec and where a given failure occurs.

The --progress, --slow-spec-threshold, --always-emit-ginkgo-writer flags
and the SuppressProgressReporting decorator have all been deprecated.  Instead
the existing -v and -vv flags better capture the level of verbosity to display.  However,
a new --show-node-events flag is added to include node `> Enter` and `< Exit` events
in the spec timeline.

In addition, JUnit reports now include the timeline (rendered with -vv) and custom JUnit
reports can be configured and generated using
`GenerateJUnitReportWithConfig(report types.Report, dst string, config JunitReportConfig)`

Code should continue to work unchanged with this version of Ginkgo - however if you have tooling that
was relying on the specific output format of Ginkgo you _may_ run into issues.  Ginkgo's console output is not guaranteed to be stable for tooling and automation purposes.  You should, instead, use Ginkgo's JSON format
to build tooling on top of as it has stronger guarantees to be stable from version to version.

### Features
- Provide details about which timeout expired [0f2fa27]

### Fixes
- Add Support Policy to docs [c70867a]

## 2.3.1

## Fixes
Several users were invoking `ginkgo` by installing the latest version of the cli via `go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2/ginkgo@latest`.  When 2.3.0 was released this resulted in an influx of issues as CI systems failed due to a change in the internal contract between the Ginkgo CLI and the Ginkgo library.  Ginkgo only supports running the same version of the library as the cli (which is why both are packaged in the same repository).

With this patch release, the ginkgo CLI can now identify a version mismatch and emit a helpful error message.

- Ginkgo cli can identify version mismatches and emit a helpful error message [bc4ae2f]
- further emphasize that a version match is required when running Ginkgo on CI and/or locally [2691dd8]

### Maintenance
- bump gomega to v1.22.0 [822a937]

## 2.3.0

### Interruptible Nodes and Timeouts

Ginkgo now supports per-node and per-spec timeouts on interruptible nodes.  Check out the [documentation for all the details](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#spec-timeouts-and-interruptible-nodes) but the gist is you can now write specs like this:

```go
It("is interruptible", func(ctx SpecContext) { // or context.Context instead of SpecContext, both are valid.
    // do things until `ctx.Done()` is closed, for example:
    req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "POST", "/build-widgets", nil)
    Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccured())
    _, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
    Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccured())

    Eventually(client.WidgetCount).WithContext(ctx).Should(Equal(17))
}, NodeTimeout(time.Second*20), GracePeriod(5*time.Second))
```

and have Ginkgo ensure that the node completes before the timeout elapses.  If it does elapse, or if an external interrupt is received (e.g. `^C`) then Ginkgo will cancel the context and wait for the Grace Period for the node to exit before proceeding with any cleanup nodes associated with the spec.  The `ctx` provided by Ginkgo can also be passed down to Gomega's `Eventually` to have all assertions within the node governed by a single deadline.

### Features

- Ginkgo now records any additional failures that occur during the cleanup of a failed spec.  In prior versions this information was quietly discarded, but the introduction of a more rigorous approach to timeouts and interruptions allows Ginkgo to better track subsequent failures.
- `SpecContext` also provides a mechanism for third-party libraries to provide additional information when a Progress Report is generated.  Gomega uses this to provide the current state of an `Eventually().WithContext()` assertion when a Progress Report is requested.
- DescribeTable now exits with an error if it is not passed any Entries [a4c9865]

## Fixes
- fixes crashes on newer Ruby 3 installations by upgrading github-pages gem dependency [92c88d5]
- Make the outline command able to use the DSL import [1be2427]

## 2.2.0

### Generate real-time Progress Reports [f91377c]

Ginkgo can now generate Progress Reports to point users at the current running line of code (including a preview of the actual source code) and a best guess at the most relevant subroutines.

These Progress Reports allow users to debug stuck or slow tests without exiting the Ginkgo process.  A Progress Report can be generated at any time by sending Ginkgo a `SIGINFO` (`^T` on MacOS/BSD) or `SIGUSR1`.

In addition, the user can specify `--poll-progress-after` and `--poll-progress-interval` to have Ginkgo start periodically emitting progress reports if a given node takes too long.  These can be overriden/set on a per-node basis with the `PollProgressAfter` and `PollProgressInterval` decorators.

Progress Reports are emitted to stdout, and also stored in the machine-redable report formats that Ginkgo supports.

Ginkgo also uses this progress reporting infrastructure under the hood when handling timeouts and interrupts.  This yields much more focused, useful, and informative stack traces than previously.

### Features
- `BeforeSuite`, `AfterSuite`, `SynchronizedBeforeSuite`, `SynchronizedAfterSuite`, and `ReportAfterSuite` now support (the relevant subset of) decorators.  These can be passed in _after_ the callback functions that are usually passed into these nodes.

  As a result the **signature of these methods has changed** and now includes a trailing `args ...interface{}`.  For most users simply using the DSL, this change is transparent.  However if you were assigning one of these functions to a custom variable (or passing it around) then your code may need to change to reflect the new signature.

### Maintenance
- Modernize the invocation of Ginkgo in github actions [0ffde58]
- Update reocmmended CI settings in docs [896bbb9]
- Speed up unnecessarily slow integration test [6d3a90e]

## 2.0.0

See [https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/MIGRATING_TO_V2](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/MIGRATING_TO_V2)

## 1.16.5

Ginkgo 2.0 now has a Release Candidate.  1.16.5 advertises the existence of the RC.
1.16.5 deprecates GinkgoParallelNode in favor of GinkgoParallelProcess

You can silence the RC advertisement by setting an `ACK_GINKGO_RC=true` environment variable or creating a file in your home directory called `.ack-ginkgo-rc`

## 1.16.4

### Fixes
1.16.4 retracts 1.16.3.  There are no code changes.  The 1.16.3 tag was associated with the wrong commit and an attempt to change it after-the-fact has proven problematic.  1.16.4 retracts 1.16.3 in Ginkgo's go.mod and creates a new, correctly tagged, release.

## 1.16.3

## 1.4.0 7/16/2017

- `ginkgo` now provides a hint if you accidentally forget to run `ginkgo bootstrap` to generate a `*_suite_test.go` file that actually invokes the Ginkgo test runner. [#345](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo/pull/345)
- thanks to improvements in `go test -c` `ginkgo` no longer needs to fix Go's compilation output to ensure compilation errors are expressed relative to the CWD. [#357]
- `ginkgo watch -watchRegExp=...` allows you to specify a custom regular expression to watch.  Only files matching the regular expression are watched for changes (the default is `\.go$`) [#356]
- `ginkgo` now always emits compilation output.  Previously, only failed compilation output was printed out. [#277]
- `ginkgo -requireSuite` now fails the test run if there are `*_test.go` files but `go test` fails to detect any tests.  Typically this means you forgot to run `ginkgo bootstrap` to generate a suite file. [#344]
- `ginkgo -timeout=DURATION` allows you to adjust the timeout for the entire test suite (default is 24 hours) [#248]

## 1.3.0 3/28/2017

Improvements:

- Significantly improved parallel test distribution.  Now instead of pre-sharding test cases across workers (which can result in idle workers and poor test performance) Ginkgo uses a shared queue to keep all workers busy until all tests are complete.  This improves test-time performance and consistency.
- `Skip(message)` can be used to skip the current test.
- Added `extensions/table` - a Ginkgo DSL for [Table Driven Tests](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#table-driven-tests)
- Add `GinkgoRandomSeed()` - shorthand for `config.GinkgoConfig.RandomSeed`
- Support for retrying flaky tests with `--flakeAttempts`
- `ginkgo ./...` now recurses as you'd expect
- Added `Specify` a synonym for `It`
- Support colorise on Windows
- Broader support for various go compilation flags in the `ginkgo` CLI

Bug Fixes:

- Ginkgo tests now fail when you `panic(nil)` (#167)

## 1.2.0 5/31/2015

Improvements

- `ginkgo -coverpkg` calls down to `go test -coverpkg` (#160)
- `ginkgo -afterSuiteHook COMMAND` invokes the passed-in `COMMAND` after a test suite completes (#152)
- Relaxed requirement for Go 1.4+.  `ginkgo` now works with Go v1.3+ (#166)

## 1.2.0-beta

Ginkgo now requires Go 1.4+

Improvements:

- Call reporters in reverse order when announcing spec completion -- allows custom reporters to emit output before the default reporter does.
- Improved focus behavior.  Now, this:

    ```golang
    FDescribe("Some describe", func() {
        It("A", func() {})

        FIt("B", func() {})
    })
    ```

  will run `B` but *not* `A`.  This tends to be a common usage pattern when in the thick of writing and debugging tests.
- When `SIGINT` is received, Ginkgo will emit the contents of the `GinkgoWriter` before running the `AfterSuite`.  Useful for debugging stuck tests.
- When `--progress` is set, Ginkgo will write test progress (in particular, Ginkgo will say when it is about to run a BeforeEach, AfterEach, It, etc...) to the `GinkgoWriter`.  This is useful for debugging stuck tests and tests that generate many logs.
- Improved output when an error occurs in a setup or teardown block.
- When `--dryRun` is set, Ginkgo will walk the spec tree and emit to its reporter *without* actually running anything.  Best paired with `-v` to understand which specs will run in which order.
- Add `By` to help document long `It`s.  `By` simply writes to the `GinkgoWriter`.
- Add support for precompiled tests:
    - `ginkgo build <path-to-package>` will now compile the package, producing a file named `package.test`
    - The compiled `package.test` file can be run directly.  This runs the tests in series.
    - To run precompiled tests in parallel, you can run: `ginkgo -p package.test`
- Support `bootstrap`ping and `generate`ing [Agouti](http://agouti.org) specs.
- `ginkgo generate` and `ginkgo bootstrap` now honor the package name already defined in a given directory
- The `ginkgo` CLI ignores `SIGQUIT`.  Prevents its stack dump from interlacing with the underlying test suite's stack dump.
- The `ginkgo` CLI now compiles tests into a temporary directory instead of the package directory.  This necessitates upgrading to Go v1.4+.
- `ginkgo -notify` now works on Linux

Bug Fixes:

- If --skipPackages is used and all packages are skipped, Ginkgo should exit 0.
- Fix tempfile leak when running in parallel
- Fix incorrect failure message when a panic occurs during a parallel test run
- Fixed an issue where a pending test within a focused context (or a focused test within a pending context) would skip all other tests.
- Be more consistent about handling SIGTERM as well as SIGINT
- When interrupted while concurrently compiling test suites in the background, Ginkgo now cleans up the compiled artifacts.
- Fixed a long standing bug where `ginkgo -p` would hang if a process spawned by one of the Ginkgo parallel nodes does not exit. (Hooray!)

## 1.1.0 (8/2/2014)

No changes, just dropping the beta.

## 1.1.0-beta (7/22/2014)
New Features:

- `ginkgo watch` now monitors packages *and their dependencies* for changes.  The depth of the dependency tree can be modified with the `-depth` flag.
- Test suites with a programmatic focus (`FIt`, `FDescribe`, etc...) exit with non-zero status code, even when they pass.  This allows CI systems to detect accidental commits of focused test suites.
- `ginkgo -p` runs the testsuite in parallel with an auto-detected number of nodes.
- `ginkgo -tags=TAG_LIST` passes a list of tags down to the `go build` command.
- `ginkgo --failFast` aborts the test suite after the first failure.
- `ginkgo generate file_1 file_2` can take multiple file arguments.
- Ginkgo now summarizes any spec failures that occurred at the end of the test run. 
- `ginkgo --randomizeSuites` will run tests *suites* in random order using the generated/passed-in seed.

Improvements:

- `ginkgo -skipPackage` now takes a comma-separated list of strings.  If the *relative path* to a package matches one of the entries in the comma-separated list, that package is skipped.
- `ginkgo --untilItFails` no longer recompiles between attempts.
- Ginkgo now panics when a runnable node (`It`, `BeforeEach`, `JustBeforeEach`, `AfterEach`, `Measure`) is nested within another runnable node.  This is always a mistake.  Any test suites that panic because of this change should be fixed.

Bug Fixes:

- `ginkgo boostrap` and `ginkgo generate` no longer fail when dealing with `hyphen-separated-packages`.
- parallel specs are now better distributed across nodes - fixed a crashing bug where (for example) distributing 11 tests across 7 nodes would panic

## 1.0.0 (5/24/2014)
New Features:

- Add `GinkgoParallelNode()` - shorthand for `config.GinkgoConfig.ParallelNode`

Improvements:

- When compilation fails, the compilation output is rewritten to present a correct *relative* path.  Allows ⌘-clicking in iTerm open the file in your text editor.
- `--untilItFails` and `ginkgo watch` now generate new random seeds between test runs, unless a particular random seed is specified.

Bug Fixes:

- `-cover` now generates a correctly combined coverprofile when running with in parallel with multiple `-node`s.
- Print out the contents of the `GinkgoWriter` when `BeforeSuite` or `AfterSuite` fail.
- Fix all remaining race conditions in Ginkgo's test suite.

## 1.0.0-beta (4/14/2014)
Breaking changes:

- `thirdparty/gomocktestreporter` is gone.  Use `GinkgoT()` instead
- Modified the Reporter interface 
- `watch` is now a subcommand, not a flag.

DSL changes:

- `BeforeSuite` and `AfterSuite` for setting up and tearing down test suites.
- `AfterSuite` is triggered on interrupt (`^C`) as well as exit.
- `SynchronizedBeforeSuite` and `SynchronizedAfterSuite` for setting up and tearing down singleton resources across parallel nodes.

CLI changes:

- `watch` is now a subcommand, not a flag
- `--nodot` flag can be passed to `ginkgo generate` and `ginkgo bootstrap` to avoid dot imports.  This explicitly imports all exported identifiers in Ginkgo and Gomega.  Refreshing this list can be done by running `ginkgo nodot`
- Additional arguments can be passed to specs.  Pass them after the `--` separator
- `--skipPackage` flag takes a regexp and ignores any packages with package names passing said regexp.
- `--trace` flag prints out full stack traces when errors occur, not just the line at which the error occurs.

Misc:

- Start using semantic versioning
- Start maintaining changelog

Major refactor:

- Pull out Ginkgo's internal to `internal`
- Rename `example` everywhere to `spec`
- Much more!
