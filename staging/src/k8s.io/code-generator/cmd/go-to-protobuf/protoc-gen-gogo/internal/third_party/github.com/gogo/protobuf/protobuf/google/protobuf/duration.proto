// A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
// as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
// resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
// or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
// two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
// from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.
//
// # Examples
//
// Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
//
//     Timestamp start = ...;
//     Timestamp end = ...;
//     Duration duration = ...;
//
//     duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;
//     duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;
//
//     if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {
//       duration.seconds += 1;
//       duration.nanos -= 1000000000;
//     } else if (durations.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {
//       duration.seconds -= 1;
//       duration.nanos += 1000000000;
//     }
//
// Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
//
//     Timestamp start = ...;
//     Duration duration = ...;
//     Timestamp end = ...;
//
//     end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;
//     end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;
//
//     if (end.nanos < 0) {
//       end.seconds -= 1;
//       end.nanos += 1000000000;
//     } else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {
//       end.seconds += 1;
//       end.nanos -= 1000000000;
//     }
//
// Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.
//
//     td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)
//     duration = Duration()
//     duration.FromTimedelta(td)
//
// # JSON Mapping
//
// In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an
// object, where the string ends in the suffix "s" (indicating seconds) and
// is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as
// fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be
// encoded in JSON format as "3s", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should
// be expressed in JSON format as "3.000000001s", and 3 seconds and 1
// microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as "3.000001s".
//
