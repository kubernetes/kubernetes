## z-pages

## Purpose

<!---
TODO: Placeholder README. Add more details, KEP for z-pags here.
--> 

The purpose of this effort is to enhance the observability, troubleshooting, and debugging capabilities of core Kubernetes components by integrating with a suite of z-pages. This will provide a standardized, low-overhead way to expose internal component metrics, runtime statistics, and configuration details, enabling users to gain deeper insights into the behavior and performance of the core components.
