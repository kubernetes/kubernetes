// Package kubeletplugin provides helper functions for running a dynamic
// resource allocation kubelet plugin.
//
// A DRA driver using this package can be deployed as a DaemonSet on suitable
// nodes. Node labeling, for example through NFD
// (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery), can be used
// to run the driver only on nodes which have the necessary hardware.
//
// The service account of the DaemonSet must have sufficient RBAC permissions
// to read ResourceClaims and to create and update ResourceSlices, if
// the driver intends to publish per-node ResourceSlices. It is good
// security practice (but not required) to limit access to ResourceSlices
// associated with the node a specific Pod is running on. This can be done
// with a Validating Admission Policy (VAP). For more information,
// see the deployment of the DRA example driver
// (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-example-driver/tree/main/deployments/helm/dra-example-driver/templates).
//
// Traditionally, the kubelet has not supported rolling updates of plugins.
// Therefore the DaemonSet must not set `maxSurge` to a value larger than
// zero. With the default `maxSurge: 0`, updating the DaemonSet of the driver
// will first shut down the old driver Pod, then start the replacement.
//
// This leads to a short downtime for operations that need the driver:
//   - Pods cannot start unless the claims they depend on were already
//     prepared for use.
//   - Cleanup after the last pod which used a claim gets delayed
//     until the driver is available again. The pod is not marked
//     as terminated. This prevents reusing the resources used by
//     the pod for other pods.
//   - Running pods are *not* affected as far as Kubernetes is
//     concerned. However, a DRA driver might provide required runtime
//     services. Vendors need to document this.
//
// Note that the second point also means that draining a node should
// first evict normal pods, then the driver DaemonSet Pod.
//
// Starting with Kubernetes 1.33, the kubelet supports rolling updates
// such that old and new Pod run at the same time for a short while
// and hand over work gracefully, with no downtime.
// However, there is no mechanism for determining in advance whether
// the node the DaemonSet runs on supports that. Trying
// to do a rolling update with a kubelet which does not support it yet
// will fail because shutting down the old Pod unregisters the driver
// even though the new Pod is running. See
// https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.33.0/pkg/kubelet/pluginmanager/pluginwatcher/README.md#seamless-upgrade
// for details.
//
// A DRA driver can either require 1.33 as minimal Kubernetes version or
// provide two variants of its DaemonSet deployment. In the variant with
// support for rolling updates, `maxSurge` can be set to a non-zero
// value. Administrators have to be careful about running the right variant.
