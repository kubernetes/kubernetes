	// For example, if your plugin has to notify the scheduling result to an external component,

	// It's different from when to return Unschedulable/UnschedulableAndUnresolvable,

	// In the case of returning Pending, we cannot say the scheduling cycle is wasted
	// because the scheduling result is used to proceed the Pod's scheduling forward,
