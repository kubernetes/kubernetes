# sample-apiserver

Demonstration of how to use the k8s.io/apiserver library to build a functional API server.

**Note:** go-get or vendor this package as `k8s.io/sample-apiserver`.

## Purpose

You may use this code if you want to build an Extension API Server to use with API Aggregation, or to build a stand-alone Kubernetes-style API server.

However, consider two other options:
  * **CRDs**:  if you just want to add a resource to your kubernetes cluster, then consider using Custom Resource Definition a.k.a CRDs.  They require less coding and rebasing.  Read about the differences between Custom Resource Definitions vs Extension API Servers [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources).
  * **Apiserver-builder**: If you want to build an Extension API server, consider using [apiserver-builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/apiserver-builder) instead of this repo.  The Apiserver-builder is a complete framework for generating the apiserver, client libraries, and the installation program.

If you do decide to use this repository, then the recommended pattern is to fork this repository, modify it to add your types, and then periodically rebase your changes on top of this repo, to pick up improvements and bug fixes to the apiserver.


## Compatibility

HEAD of this repo will match HEAD of k8s.io/apiserver, k8s.io/apimachinery, and k8s.io/client-go.

## Where does it come from?

`sample-apiserver` is synced from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/sample-apiserver.
Code changes are made in that location, merged into `k8s.io/kubernetes` and later synced here.

## Fetch sample-apiserver and its dependencies

Issue the following commands --- starting in whatever working directory you
like.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-apiserver
cd sample-apiserver
```

### When using Go modules

Note, however, that if you intend to
[generate code](#changes-to-the-types) then you will also need the
code-generator repo to exist in an old-style location.  One easy way
to do this is to use the command `go mod vendor` to create and
populate the `vendor` directory.

### A Note on kubernetes/kubernetes

If you are developing Kubernetes according to
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md
then you already have a copy of this demo in
`kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io/sample-apiserver` and its dependencies
--- including the code generator --- are in usable locations.


## Normal Build and Deploy

### Changes to the Types

If you change the API object type definitions in any of the
`pkg/apis/.../types.go` files then you will need to update the files
generated from the type definitions.  To do this, first
[create the vendor directory if necessary](#when-using-go-modules)
and then invoke `hack/update-codegen.sh` with `sample-apiserver` as
your current working directory; the script takes no arguments.

### Authentication plugins

The normal build supports only a very spare selection of
authentication methods.  There is a much larger set available in
https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/tree/master/plugin/pkg/client/auth
.  If you want your server to support one of those, such as `oidc`,
then add an import of the appropriate package to
`sample-apiserver/main.go`.  Here is an example:

``` go
import _ "k8s.io/client-go/plugin/pkg/client/auth/oidc"
```

Alternatively you could add support for all of them, with an import
like this:

``` go
import _ "k8s.io/client-go/plugin/pkg/client/auth"
```

### Build the Binary

With `sample-apiserver` as your current working directory, issue the
following command:

```
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -a -o artifacts/simple-image/kube-sample-apiserver
```

### Build the Container Image

With `sample-apiserver` as your current working directory, issue the
following commands with `MYPREFIX` and `MYTAG` replaced by something
suitable.

```
docker build -t MYPREFIX/kube-sample-apiserver:MYTAG ./artifacts/simple-image
docker push MYPREFIX/kube-sample-apiserver:MYTAG
```

### Deploy into a Kubernetes Cluster

Edit `artifacts/example/deployment.yaml`, updating the pod template's image
reference to match what you pushed and setting the `imagePullPolicy`
to something suitable.  Then call:

```
kubectl apply -f artifacts/example
```

## Running it stand-alone

During development it is helpful to run sample-apiserver stand-alone, i.e. without
a Kubernetes API server for authn/authz and without aggregation. This is possible, but needs
a couple of flags, keys and certs as described below. You will still need some kubeconfig,
e.g. `~/.kube/config`, but the Kubernetes cluster is not used for authn/z. A minikube or
hack/local-up-cluster.sh cluster will work.

Instead of trusting the aggregator inside kube-apiserver, the described setup uses local
client certificate based X.509 authentication and authorization. This means that the client
certificate is trusted by a CA and the passed certificate contains the group membership
to the `system:masters` group. As we disable delegated authorization with `--authorization-skip-lookup`,
only this superuser group is authorized.

1. First we need a CA to later sign the client certificate:

   ``` shell
   openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt
   ```

2. Then we create a client cert signed by this CA for the user `development` in the superuser group
   `system:masters`:

   ``` shell
   openssl req -out client.csr -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout client.key -subj "/CN=development/O=system:masters"
   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -sha256 -out client.crt
   ```

3. As curl requires client certificates in p12 format with password, do the conversion:

   ``` shell
   openssl pkcs12 -export -in ./client.crt -inkey ./client.key -out client.p12 -passout pass:password
   ```

4. With these keys and certs in-place, we start the server:

   ``` shell
   etcd &
   sample-apiserver --secure-port 8443 --etcd-servers http://127.0.0.1:2379 --v=7 \
      --client-ca-file ca.crt \
      --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config \
      --authentication-kubeconfig ~/.kube/config \
      --authorization-kubeconfig ~/.kube/config
   ```

   The first kubeconfig is used for the shared informers to access
   Kubernetes resources. The second kubeconfig passed to
   `--authentication-kubeconfig` is used to satisfy the delegated
   authenticator. The third kubeconfig passed to
   `--authorized-kubeconfig` is used to satisfy the delegated
   authorizer. Neither the authenticator, nor the authorizer will
   actually be used: due to `--client-ca-file`, our development X.509
   certificate is accepted and authenticates us as `system:masters`
   member. `system:masters` is the superuser group such that delegated
   authorization is skipped.

5. Use curl to access the server using the client certificate in p12 format for authentication:

   ``` shell
   curl -fv -k --cert-type P12 --cert client.p12:password \
      https://localhost:8443/apis/wardle.example.com/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/flunders
   ```

   Or use wget:
   ``` shell
   wget -O- --no-check-certificate \
      --certificate client.crt --private-key client.key \
      https://localhost:8443/apis/wardle.example.com/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/flunders
   ```

   Note: Recent OSX versions broke client certs with curl. On Mac try `brew install httpie` and then:

   ``` shell
   http --verify=no --cert client.crt --cert-key client.key \
      https://localhost:8443/apis/wardle.example.com/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/flunders
   ```
