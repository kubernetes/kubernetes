// Package v1 contains API types that are common to all versions.
//
// The package contains two categories of types:
// - external (serialized) types that lack their own version (e.g TypeMeta)
// - internal (never-serialized) types that are needed by several different
//   api groups, and so live here, to avoid duplication and/or import loops
//   (e.g. LabelSelector).
// In the future, we will probably move these categories of objects into
// separate packages.
