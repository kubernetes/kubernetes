	// A binding is invalid if paramRef.name refers to a non-existent resource.

	//
	// If a parameter object is provided, it can be accessed via the `params` handle in the same
	// manner as validation expressions.
	//

	// 1. If ANY matchCondition evaluates to FALSE, the policy is skipped.
	// 2. If ALL matchConditions evaluate to TRUE, the policy is evaluated.
