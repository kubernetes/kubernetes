	// The name of the admission webhook.
	// Name should be fully qualified, e.g., imagepolicy.kubernetes.io, where
	// "imagepolicy" is the name of the webhook, and kubernetes.io is the name
	// of the organization.
	// Required.
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// ClientConfig defines how to communicate with the hook.
	// Required
	ClientConfig *WebhookClientConfigApplyConfiguration `json:"clientConfig,omitempty"`
	// Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook cares about.
	// The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule.
	// However, in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks
	// from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be recovered from without completely
	// disabling the plugin, ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are never called
	// on admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.
	Rules []v1.RuleWithOperationsApplyConfiguration `json:"rules,omitempty"`
	// FailurePolicy defines how unrecognized errors from the admission endpoint are handled -
	// allowed values are Ignore or Fail. Defaults to Ignore.
	FailurePolicy *admissionregistrationv1beta1.FailurePolicyType `json:"failurePolicy,omitempty"`
	// matchPolicy defines how the "rules" list is used to match incoming requests.
	// Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent".
	//
	// - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule.
	// For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,
	// but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`,
	// a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook.
	//
	// - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version.
	// For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1,
	// and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`,
	// a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the webhook.
	//

	MatchPolicy *admissionregistrationv1beta1.MatchPolicyType `json:"matchPolicy,omitempty"`
	// NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on an object based
	// on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the
	// object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on
	// object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource,
	// it never skips the webhook.
	//
	// For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not
	// associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as
	// follows:
	// "namespaceSelector": {
	// "matchExpressions": [
	// {
	// "key": "runlevel",
	// "operator": "NotIn",
	// "values": [
	// "0",
	// "1"
	// ]
	// }
	// ]
	// }
	//
	// If instead you want to only run the webhook on any objects whose
	// namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging";
	// you will set the selector as follows:
	// "namespaceSelector": {
	// "matchExpressions": [
	// {
	// "key": "environment",
	// "operator": "In",
	// "values": [
	// "prod",

	//
	// See
	// https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/
	// for more examples of label selectors.
	//
	// Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.
	NamespaceSelector *metav1.LabelSelectorApplyConfiguration `json:"namespaceSelector,omitempty"`
	// ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook based on if the
	// object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both
	// the oldObject and newObject that would be sent to the webhook, and
	// is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A null
	// object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of
	// delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a
	// DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to
	// match.
	// Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end
	// users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels.
	// Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.
	ObjectSelector *metav1.LabelSelectorApplyConfiguration `json:"objectSelector,omitempty"`
	// SideEffects states whether this webhook has side effects.
	// Acceptable values are: Unknown, None, Some, NoneOnDryRun
	// Webhooks with side effects MUST implement a reconciliation system, since a request may be
	// rejected by a future step in the admission chain and the side effects therefore need to be undone.
	// Requests with the dryRun attribute will be auto-rejected if they match a webhook with
	// sideEffects == Unknown or Some. Defaults to Unknown.
	SideEffects *admissionregistrationv1beta1.SideEffectClass `json:"sideEffects,omitempty"`
	// TimeoutSeconds specifies the timeout for this webhook. After the timeout passes,
	// the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will fail based on the
	// failure policy.
	// The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds.
	// Default to 30 seconds.
	TimeoutSeconds *int32 `json:"timeoutSeconds,omitempty"`
	// AdmissionReviewVersions is an ordered list of preferred `AdmissionReview`
	// versions the Webhook expects. API server will try to use first version in
	// the list which it supports. If none of the versions specified in this list
	// supported by API server, validation will fail for this object.
	// If a persisted webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not
	// include any versions known to the API Server, calls to the webhook will fail
	// and be subject to the failure policy.
	// Default to `['v1beta1']`.
	AdmissionReviewVersions []string `json:"admissionReviewVersions,omitempty"`
	// reinvocationPolicy indicates whether this webhook should be called multiple times as part of a single admission evaluation.
	// Allowed values are "Never" and "IfNeeded".
	//
	// Never: the webhook will not be called more than once in a single admission evaluation.
	//
	// IfNeeded: the webhook will be called at least one additional time as part of the admission evaluation
	// if the object being admitted is modified by other admission plugins after the initial webhook call.
	// Webhooks that specify this option *must* be idempotent, able to process objects they previously admitted.
	// Note:
	// * the number of additional invocations is not guaranteed to be exactly one.
	// * if additional invocations result in further modifications to the object, webhooks are not guaranteed to be invoked again.
	// * webhooks that use this option may be reordered to minimize the number of additional invocations.
	// * to validate an object after all mutations are guaranteed complete, use a validating admission webhook instead.
	//
	// Defaults to "Never".

	// MatchConditions is a list of conditions that must be met for a request to be sent to this

	// There are a maximum of 64 match conditions allowed.
	//
	// The exact matching logic is (in order):
	// 1. If ANY matchCondition evaluates to FALSE, the webhook is skipped.
	// 2. If ALL matchConditions evaluate to TRUE, the webhook is called.
	// 3. If any matchCondition evaluates to an error (but none are FALSE):
	// - If failurePolicy=Fail, reject the request
