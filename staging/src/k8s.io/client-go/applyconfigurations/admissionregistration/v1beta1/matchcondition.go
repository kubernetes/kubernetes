	// must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'MyName',  or 'my.name',  or
	// '123-abc', regex used for validation is '([A-Za-z0-9][-A-Za-z0-9_.]*)?[A-Za-z0-9]') with an

	// 'object' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests.
	// 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests.
	// 'request' - Attributes of the admission request(/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest).
	// 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.
	// See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz
	// 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the
	// request resource.
	// Documentation on CEL: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/
