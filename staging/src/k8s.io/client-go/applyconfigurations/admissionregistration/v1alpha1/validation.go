// ValidationApplyConfiguration represents a declarative configuration of the Validation type for use
// with apply.
//
// Validation specifies the CEL expression which is used to apply the validation.
type ValidationApplyConfiguration struct {
	// Expression represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL.
	// ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec
	// CEL expressions have access to the contents of the API request/response, organized into CEL variables as well as some other useful variables:
	//
	// - 'object' - The object from the incoming request. The value is null for DELETE requests.
	// - 'oldObject' - The existing object. The value is null for CREATE requests.
	// - 'request' - Attributes of the API request([ref](/pkg/apis/admission/types.go#AdmissionRequest)).
	// - 'params' - Parameter resource referred to by the policy binding being evaluated. Only populated if the policy has a ParamKind.
	// - 'namespaceObject' - The namespace object that the incoming object belongs to. The value is null for cluster-scoped resources.
	// - 'variables' - Map of composited variables, from its name to its lazily evaluated value.
	// For example, a variable named 'foo' can be accessed as 'variables.foo'.
	// - 'authorizer' - A CEL Authorizer. May be used to perform authorization checks for the principal (user or service account) of the request.
	// See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/cel/library#Authz
	// - 'authorizer.requestResource' - A CEL ResourceCheck constructed from the 'authorizer' and configured with the
	// request resource.
	//
	// The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the
	// object. No other metadata properties are accessible.
	//
	// Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible.
	// Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression:
	// - '__' escapes to '__underscores__'
	// - '.' escapes to '__dot__'
	// - '-' escapes to '__dash__'
	// - '/' escapes to '__slash__'
	// - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:
	// "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue", "else", "for", "function", "if",
	// "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace", "return".
	// Examples:
	// - Expression accessing a property named "namespace": {"Expression": "object.__namespace__ > 0"}
	// - Expression accessing a property named "x-prop": {"Expression": "object.x__dash__prop > 0"}
	// - Expression accessing a property named "redact__d": {"Expression": "object.redact__underscores__d > 0"}
	//
	// Equality on arrays with list type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1].
	// Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:
	// - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and
	// non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.
	// - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values
	// are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with
	// non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.
	// Required.
	Expression *string `json:"expression,omitempty"`
	// Message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Expression contains
	// line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks.
	// If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}".
	// e.g. "must be a URL with the host matching spec.host"
	// If the Expression contains line breaks. Message is required.
	// The message must not contain line breaks.
	// If unset, the message is "failed Expression: {Expression}".
	Message *string `json:"message,omitempty"`
	// Reason represents a machine-readable description of why this validation failed.
	// If this is the first validation in the list to fail, this reason, as well as the
	// corresponding HTTP response code, are used in the
	// HTTP response to the client.
	// The currently supported reasons are: "Unauthorized", "Forbidden", "Invalid", "RequestEntityTooLarge".
	// If not set, StatusReasonInvalid is used in the response to the client.
	Reason *v1.StatusReason `json:"reason,omitempty"`
	// messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
	// Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
	// If both message and messageExpression are present on a validation, then messageExpression will be used if validation fails.
	// If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the runtime error is logged, and the validation failure message is produced
	// as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
	// that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset, and
	// the fact that messageExpression produced an empty string/string with only spaces/string with line breaks will be logged.
	// messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the `expression` except for 'authorizer' and 'authorizer.requestResource'.
	// Example:
	// "object.x must be less than max ("+string(params.max)+")"
