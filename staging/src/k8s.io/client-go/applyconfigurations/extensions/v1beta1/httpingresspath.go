// HTTPIngressPathApplyConfiguration represents a declarative configuration of the HTTPIngressPath type for use
// with apply.
//
// HTTPIngressPath associates a path with a backend. Incoming urls matching the
// path are forwarded to the backend.
type HTTPIngressPathApplyConfiguration struct {
	// Path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can
	// contain characters disallowed from the conventional "path" part of a URL
	// as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a '/'. When unspecified,
	// all paths from incoming requests are matched.
	Path *string `json:"path,omitempty"`
	// PathType determines the interpretation of the Path matching. PathType can
	// be one of the following values:
	// * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
	// * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
	// done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
	// list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
	// match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
	// request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
	// of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
	// matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
	// * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
	// the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
	// or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
	// Implementations are required to support all path types.
	// Defaults to ImplementationSpecific.
