	// `queues` is the number of queues for this priority level. The
	// queues exist independently at each apiserver. The value must be
	// positive.  Setting it to 1 effectively precludes
	// shufflesharding and thus makes the distinguisher method of
	// associated flow schemas irrelevant.  This field has a default
	// value of 64.

	// `handSize` is a small positive number that configures the
	// shuffle sharding of requests into queues.  When enqueuing a request
	// at this priority level the request's flow identifier (a string
	// pair) is hashed and the hash value is used to shuffle the list
	// of queues and deal a hand of the size specified here.  The
	// request is put into one of the shortest queues in that hand.
	// `handSize` must be no larger than `queues`, and should be
	// significantly smaller (so that a few heavy flows do not
	// saturate most of the queues).  See the user-facing
	// documentation for more extensive guidance on setting this
	// field.  This field has a default value of 8.

	// `queueLengthLimit` is the maximum number of requests allowed to
	// be waiting in a given queue of this priority level at a time;

	// not specified, it will be defaulted to 50.
