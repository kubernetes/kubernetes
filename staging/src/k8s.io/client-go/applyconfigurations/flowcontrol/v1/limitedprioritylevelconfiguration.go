// LimitedPriorityLevelConfigurationApplyConfiguration represents a declarative configuration of the LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration type for use
// with apply.
//
// LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration specifies how to handle requests that are subject to limits.
// It addresses two issues:
// - How are requests for this priority level limited?
// - What should be done with requests that exceed the limit?
type LimitedPriorityLevelConfigurationApplyConfiguration struct {
	// `nominalConcurrencyShares` (NCS) contributes to the computation of the
	// NominalConcurrencyLimit (NominalCL) of this level.
	// This is the number of execution seats available at this priority level.
	// This is used both for requests dispatched from this priority level
	// as well as requests dispatched from other priority levels
	// borrowing seats from this level.
	// The server's concurrency limit (ServerCL) is divided among the
	// Limited priority levels in proportion to their NCS values:
	//
	// NominalCL(i)  = ceil( ServerCL * NCS(i) / sum_ncs )
	// sum_ncs = sum[priority level k] NCS(k)
	//
	// Bigger numbers mean a larger nominal concurrency limit,
	// at the expense of every other priority level.
	//
	// If not specified, this field defaults to a value of 30.
	//
	// Setting this field to zero supports the construction of a
	// "jail" for this priority level that is used to hold some request(s)
	NominalConcurrencyShares *int32 `json:"nominalConcurrencyShares,omitempty"`
	// `limitResponse` indicates what to do with requests that can not be executed right now
	LimitResponse *LimitResponseApplyConfiguration `json:"limitResponse,omitempty"`
	// `lendablePercent` prescribes the fraction of the level's NominalCL that
	// can be borrowed by other priority levels. The value of this
	// field must be between 0 and 100, inclusive, and it defaults to 0.
	// The number of seats that other levels can borrow from this level, known
	// as this level's LendableConcurrencyLimit (LendableCL), is defined as follows.
	//
	// LendableCL(i) = round( NominalCL(i) * lendablePercent(i)/100.0 )
	LendablePercent *int32 `json:"lendablePercent,omitempty"`
	// `borrowingLimitPercent`, if present, configures a limit on how many
	// seats this priority level can borrow from other priority levels.
	// The limit is known as this level's BorrowingConcurrencyLimit
	// (BorrowingCL) and is a limit on the total number of seats that this
	// level may borrow at any one time.
	// This field holds the ratio of that limit to the level's nominal
	// concurrency limit. When this field is non-nil, it must hold a
	// non-negative integer and the limit is calculated as follows.
	//
	// BorrowingCL(i) = round( NominalCL(i) * borrowingLimitPercent(i)/100.0 )
	//
	// The value of this field can be more than 100, implying that this
	// priority level can borrow a number of seats that is greater than
	// its own nominal concurrency limit (NominalCL).
	// When this field is left `nil`, the limit is effectively infinite.
