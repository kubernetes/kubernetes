	// Known reasons for PodGroupScheduled condition:
	// - "Scheduled": All required pods have been successfully scheduled.

	// affinity/anti-affinity rules, or insufficient capacity for the gang.
	// - "Preempted": The PodGroup was preempted to make room for higher-priority workloads.
	// - "Timeout": The PodGroup failed to schedule within the configured timeout.
