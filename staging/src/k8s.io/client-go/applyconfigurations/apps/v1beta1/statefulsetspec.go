	// replicas is the desired number of replicas of the given Template.
	// These are replicas in the sense that they are instantiations of the
	// same Template, but individual replicas also have a consistent identity.
	// If unspecified, defaults to 1.
	// TODO: Consider a rename of this field.
	Replicas *int32 `json:"replicas,omitempty"`
	// selector is a label query over pods that should match the replica count.
	// If empty, defaulted to labels on the pod template.
	// More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors
	Selector *v1.LabelSelectorApplyConfiguration `json:"selector,omitempty"`
	// template is the object that describes the pod that will be created if
	// insufficient replicas are detected. Each pod stamped out by the StatefulSet
	// will fulfill this Template, but have a unique identity from the rest
	// of the StatefulSet. Each pod will be named with the format
	// <statefulsetname>-<podindex>. For example, a pod in a StatefulSet named
	// "web" with index number "3" would be named "web-3".
	Template *corev1.PodTemplateSpecApplyConfiguration `json:"template,omitempty"`
	// volumeClaimTemplates is a list of claims that pods are allowed to reference.
	// The StatefulSet controller is responsible for mapping network identities to
	// claims in a way that maintains the identity of a pod. Every claim in
	// this list must have at least one matching (by name) volumeMount in one
	// container in the template. A claim in this list takes precedence over
	// any volumes in the template, with the same name.
	// TODO: Define the behavior if a claim already exists with the same name.

	// This service must exist before the StatefulSet, and is responsible for
	// the network identity of the set. Pods get DNS/hostnames that follow the
	// pattern: pod-specific-string.serviceName.default.svc.cluster.local
	// where "pod-specific-string" is managed by the StatefulSet controller.
	ServiceName *string `json:"serviceName,omitempty"`
	// podManagementPolicy controls how pods are created during initial scale up,
	// when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is
	// `OrderedReady`, where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then
	// pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before
	// continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order.
	// The alternative policy is `Parallel` which will create pods in parallel
	// to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete
	// all pods at once.
	PodManagementPolicy *appsv1beta1.PodManagementPolicyType `json:"podManagementPolicy,omitempty"`
	// updateStrategy indicates the StatefulSetUpdateStrategy that will be
	// employed to update Pods in the StatefulSet when a revision is made to
	// Template.
	UpdateStrategy *StatefulSetUpdateStrategyApplyConfiguration `json:"updateStrategy,omitempty"`
	// revisionHistoryLimit is the maximum number of revisions that will
	// be maintained in the StatefulSet's revision history. The revision history
	// consists of all revisions not represented by a currently applied
	// StatefulSetSpec version. The default value is 10.
	RevisionHistoryLimit *int32 `json:"revisionHistoryLimit,omitempty"`
	// minReadySeconds is the minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready
	// without any of its container crashing for it to be considered available.
	// Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)
	MinReadySeconds *int32 `json:"minReadySeconds,omitempty"`
	// persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy describes the lifecycle of persistent
	// volume claims created from volumeClaimTemplates. By default, all persistent
	// volume claims are created as needed and retained until manually deleted. This
	// policy allows the lifecycle to be altered, for example by deleting persistent
	// volume claims when their stateful set is deleted, or when their pod is scaled
	// down.
	PersistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy *StatefulSetPersistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicyApplyConfiguration `json:"persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy,omitempty"`
	// ordinals controls the numbering of replica indices in a StatefulSet. The
	// default ordinals behavior assigns a "0" index to the first replica and
	// increments the index by one for each additional replica requested.
