	// requested by only installing classes with selectors for permitted

	// then administrators can create an empty DeviceClass for users
	// to reference.

	// This is the default. The exact number is provided in the
	// count field.
	//
	// - All: This request is for all of the matching devices in a pool.
	// At least one device must exist on the node for the allocation to succeed.
	// Allocation will fail if some devices are already allocated,
	// unless adminAccess is requested.
	//
	// If AllocationMode is not specified, the default mode is ExactCount. If
	// the mode is ExactCount and count is not specified, the default count is
	// one. Any other requests must specify this field.

	// More modes may get added in the future. Clients must refuse to handle
	// requests with unknown modes.

	//
	// In addition, should any of the allocated devices get tainted
	// with NoExecute after allocation and that effect is not tolerated,
	// then all pods consuming the ResourceClaim get deleted to evict
	// them. The scheduler will not let new pods reserve the claim while
	// it has these tainted devices. Once all pods are evicted, the
	// claim will get deallocated.

	// If Count > 1,
