// CSINodeDriverApplyConfiguration represents a declarative configuration of the CSINodeDriver type for use
// with apply.
//
// CSINodeDriver holds information about the specification of one CSI driver installed on a node
type CSINodeDriverApplyConfiguration struct {
	// name represents the name of the CSI driver that this object refers to.
	// This MUST be the same name returned by the CSI GetPluginName() call for
	// that driver.
	Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// nodeID of the node from the driver point of view.
	// This field enables Kubernetes to communicate with storage systems that do
	// not share the same nomenclature for nodes. For example, Kubernetes may
	// refer to a given node as "node1", but the storage system may refer to
	// the same node as "nodeA". When Kubernetes issues a command to the storage
	// system to attach a volume to a specific node, it can use this field to
	// refer to the node name using the ID that the storage system will
	// understand, e.g. "nodeA" instead of "node1". This field is required.
	NodeID *string `json:"nodeID,omitempty"`
	// topologyKeys is the list of keys supported by the driver.
	// When a driver is initialized on a cluster, it provides a set of topology
	// keys that it understands (e.g. "company.com/zone", "company.com/region").
	// When a driver is initialized on a node, it provides the same topology keys
	// along with values. Kubelet will expose these topology keys as labels
	// on its own node object.
	// When Kubernetes does topology aware provisioning, it can use this list to
	// determine which labels it should retrieve from the node object and pass
	// back to the driver.
	// It is possible for different nodes to use different topology keys.
	// This can be empty if driver does not support topology.
	TopologyKeys []string `json:"topologyKeys,omitempty"`
	// allocatable represents the volume resources of a node that are available for scheduling.
	// This field is beta.
	Allocatable *VolumeNodeResourcesApplyConfiguration `json:"allocatable,omitempty"`
