// IngressRuleApplyConfiguration represents a declarative configuration of the IngressRule type for use
// with apply.

// IngressRule represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to
// the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host
// match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching IngressRuleValue.
type IngressRuleApplyConfiguration struct {
	// host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986.
	// Note the following deviations from the "host" part of the
	// URI as defined in RFC 3986:
	// 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to
	// the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress.
	// 2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.
	// Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and
	// :443 for https.
	// Both these may change in the future.
	// Incoming requests are matched against the host before the
	// IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all
	// traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue.
	//
	// host can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of
	// a network host (e.g. "foo.bar.com") or "wildcard", which is a domain name
	// prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. "*.foo.com").
	// The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and
	// matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == "*").
	// Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following way:
	// 1. If Host is precise, the request matches this rule if the http host header is equal to Host.
	// 2. If Host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if the http host header
	// is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule.
	Host *string `json:"host,omitempty"`
	// IngressRuleValue represents a rule to route requests for this IngressRule.
	// If unspecified, the rule defaults to a http catch-all. Whether that sends
	// just traffic matching the host to the default backend or all traffic to the
	// default backend, is left to the controller fulfilling the Ingress. Http is
	// currently the only supported IngressRuleValue.
