// Common string formats
// ---------------------
// Many fields in this API have formatting requirements.  The commonly used
// formats are defined here.
//
// C_IDENTIFIER:  This is a string that conforms to the definition of an "identifier"
//     in the C language.  This is captured by the following regex:
//         [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*
//     This defines the format, but not the length restriction, which should be
//     specified at the definition of any field of this type.
//
// DNS_LABEL:  This is a string, no more than 63 characters long, that conforms
//     to the definition of a "label" in RFCs 1035 and 1123.  This is captured
//     by the following regex:
//         [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?
//
// DNS_SUBDOMAIN:  This is a string, no more than 253 characters long, that conforms
//      to the definition of a "subdomain" in RFCs 1035 and 1123.  This is captured
//      by the following regex:
//         [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*
//     or more simply:
//         DNS_LABEL(\.DNS_LABEL)*
//
// IANA_SVC_NAME: This is a string, no more than 15 characters long, that
//      conforms to the definition of IANA service name in RFC 6335.
//      It must contains at least one letter [a-z] and it must contains only [a-z0-9-].
//      Hypens ('-') cannot be leading or trailing character of the string
//      and cannot be adjacent to other hyphens.

// ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects
// users must create.
// DEPRECATED: Use k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1.ObjectMeta instead - this type will be removed soon.
type ObjectMeta struct {
	// Name is unique within a namespace.  Name is required when creating resources, although
	// some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name
	// automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration
	// definition.
	// +optional
	Name string

	// GenerateName indicates that the name should be made unique by the server prior to persisting
	// it. A non-empty value for the field indicates the name will be made unique (and the name
	// returned to the client will be different than the name passed). The value of this field will
	// be combined with a unique suffix on the server if the Name field has not been provided.
	// The provided value must be valid within the rules for Name, and may be truncated by the length
	// of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.
	//
	// If this field is specified, and Name is not present, the server will NOT return a 409 if the
	// generated name exists - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason
	// ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client
	// should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).
	// +optional

	// Namespace defines the space within which name must be unique. An empty namespace is

	// those objects will be empty.
	// +optional

	// +optional

	// the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT
	// operations.
	// +optional
	UID types.UID

	// An opaque value that represents the version of this resource. May be used for optimistic
	// concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources.

	// +optional
	CreationTimestamp metav1.Time

	// DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
	// field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
	// directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
	// from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field. Once set,
	// this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened
	// or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that
	// a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
	// signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard
	// termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the
	// API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this
	// timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is
	// fully terminated.
	// If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.
	//
	// Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.
	// Read-only.
	// More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata

	// DeletionGracePeriodSeconds records the graceful deletion value set when graceful deletion
	// was requested. Represents the most recent grace period, and may only be shortened once set.
	// +optional
	DeletionGracePeriodSeconds *int64

	// Labels are key value pairs that may be used to scope and select individual resources.
	// Label keys are of the form:
	//     label-key ::= prefixed-name | name
	//     prefixed-name ::= prefix '/' name
	//     prefix ::= DNS_SUBDOMAIN
	//     name ::= DNS_LABEL

	// to the user.  Other system components that wish to use labels must specify a prefix.  The
	// "kubernetes.io/" prefix is reserved for use by kubernetes components.
	// +optional
	Labels map[string]string

	// Annotations are unstructured key value data stored with a resource that may be set by
	// external tooling. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying
	// objects.  Annotation keys have the same formatting restrictions as Label keys. See the
	// comments on Labels for details.
