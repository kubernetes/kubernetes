// SharedInformer provides eventually consistent linkage of its
// clients to the authoritative state of a given collection of
// objects.  An object is identified by its API group, kind/resource,
// namespace (if any), and name; the `ObjectMeta.UID` is not part of
// an object's ID as far as this contract is concerned.  One
// SharedInformer provides linkage to objects of a particular API
// group and kind/resource.  The linked object collection of a
// SharedInformer may be further restricted to one namespace (if
// applicable) and/or by label selector and/or field selector.
//
// The authoritative state of an object is what apiservers provide
// access to, and an object goes through a strict sequence of states.
// An object state is either (1) present with a ResourceVersion and
// other appropriate content or (2) "absent".
//
// A SharedInformer maintains a local cache --- exposed by GetStore(),
// by GetIndexer() in the case of an indexed informer, and possibly by
// machinery involved in creating and/or accessing the informer --- of
// the state of each relevant object.  This cache is eventually
// consistent with the authoritative state.  This means that, unless
// prevented by persistent communication problems, if ever a
// particular object ID X is authoritatively associated with a state S
// then for every SharedInformer I whose collection includes (X, S)
// eventually either (1) I's cache associates X with S or a later
// state of X, (2) I is stopped, or (3) the authoritative state
// service for X terminates.  To be formally complete, we say that the
// absent state meets any restriction by label selector or field
// selector.
//
// For a given informer and relevant object ID X, the sequence of
// states that appears in the informer's cache is a subsequence of the
// states authoritatively associated with X.  That is, some states
// might never appear in the cache but ordering among the appearing
// states is correct.  Note, however, that there is no promise about
// ordering between states seen for different objects.
//
// The local cache starts out empty, and gets populated and updated
// during `Run()`.
//
// As a simple example, if a collection of objects is henceforth
// unchanging, a SharedInformer is created that links to that
// collection, and that SharedInformer is `Run()` then that
// SharedInformer's cache eventually holds an exact copy of that
// collection (unless it is stopped too soon, the authoritative state
// service ends, or communication problems between the two
// persistently thwart achievement).
//
// As another simple example, if the local cache ever holds a
// non-absent state for some object ID and the object is eventually
// removed from the authoritative state then eventually the object is
// removed from the local cache (unless the SharedInformer is stopped
// too soon, the authoritative state service ends, or communication
// problems persistently thwart the desired result).
//
// The keys in the Store are of the form namespace/name for namespaced
// objects, and are simply the name for non-namespaced objects.
// Clients can use `MetaNamespaceKeyFunc(obj)` to extract the key for
// a given object, and `SplitMetaNamespaceKey(key)` to split a key
// into its constituent parts.
//
// Every query against the local cache is answered entirely from one
// snapshot of the cache's state.  Thus, the result of a `List` call
// will not contain two entries with the same namespace and name.
//
// A client is identified here by a ResourceEventHandler.  For every
// update to the SharedInformer's local cache and for every client
// added before `Run()`, eventually either the SharedInformer is
// stopped or the client is notified of the update.  A client added
// after `Run()` starts gets a startup batch of notifications of
// additions of the objects existing in the cache at the time that
// client was added; also, for every update to the SharedInformer's
// local cache after that client was added, eventually either the
// SharedInformer is stopped or that client is notified of that
// update.  Client notifications happen after the corresponding cache
// update and, in the case of a SharedIndexInformer, after the
// corresponding index updates.  It is possible that additional cache
// and index updates happen before such a prescribed notification.
// For a given SharedInformer and client, the notifications are
// delivered sequentially.  For a given SharedInformer, client, and
// object ID, the notifications are delivered in order.  Because
// `ObjectMeta.UID` has no role in identifying objects, it is possible
// that when (1) object O1 with ID (e.g. namespace and name) X and
// `ObjectMeta.UID` U1 in the SharedInformer's local cache is deleted
// and later (2) another object O2 with ID X and ObjectMeta.UID U2 is
// created the informer's clients are not notified of (1) and (2) but
// rather are notified only of an update from O1 to O2. Clients that
// need to detect such cases might do so by comparing the `ObjectMeta.UID`
// field of the old and the new object in the code that handles update
// notifications (i.e. `OnUpdate` method of ResourceEventHandler).
//
// A client must process each notification promptly; a SharedInformer
// is not engineered to deal well with a large backlog of
// notifications to deliver.  Lengthy processing should be passed off
// to something else, for example through a
// `client-go/util/workqueue`.
//
// A delete notification exposes the last locally known non-absent
// state, except that its ResourceVersion is replaced with a
// ResourceVersion in which the object is actually absent.
