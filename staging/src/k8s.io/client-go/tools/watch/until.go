// Watch method with Until. It can skip some intermediate events in case of watch function failing but it will
// re-list to recover and you always get an event, if there has been a change, after recovery.
// Also with the current implementation based on DeltaFIFO, order of the events you receive is guaranteed only for
// particular object, not between more of them even it's the same resource.
