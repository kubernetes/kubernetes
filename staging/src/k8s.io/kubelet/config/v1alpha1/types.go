	// a single subdomain segment, so `*.io` does not match `*.k8s.io`.

	// A match exists between an image and a matchImage when all of the below are true:
	// - Both contain the same number of domain parts and each part matches.
	// - The URL path of an imageMatch must be a prefix of the target image URL path.
	// - If the imageMatch contains a port, then the port must match in the image as well.
