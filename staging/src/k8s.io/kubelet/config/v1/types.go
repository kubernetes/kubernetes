	// Matching partial subdomains like 'app*.k8s.io' is also supported. Each glob can only match

	// plugins that operate in pass-through mode; i.e., they return the service account token as-is, they
	// can set the credentialProviderResponse.cacheDuration to 0. This will disable the caching of
	// credentials in kubelet and the plugin will be invoked for every image pull. This does result in
