// Package driveactivity provides access to the Drive Activity API.
//
// For product documentation, see: https://developers.google.com/drive/activity/
//
// Creating a client
//
// Usage example:
//
//   import "google.golang.org/api/driveactivity/v2"
//   ...
//   ctx := context.Background()
//   driveactivityService, err := driveactivity.NewService(ctx)
//
// In this example, Google Application Default Credentials are used for authentication.
//
// For information on how to create and obtain Application Default Credentials, see https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials.
//
// Other authentication options
//
// By default, all available scopes (see "Constants") are used to authenticate. To restrict scopes, use option.WithScopes:
//
//   driveactivityService, err := driveactivity.NewService(ctx, option.WithScopes(driveactivity.DriveActivityReadonlyScope))
//
// To use an API key for authentication (note: some APIs do not support API keys), use option.WithAPIKey:
//
//   driveactivityService, err := driveactivity.NewService(ctx, option.WithAPIKey("AIza..."))
//
// To use an OAuth token (e.g., a user token obtained via a three-legged OAuth flow), use option.WithTokenSource:
//
//   config := &oauth2.Config{...}
//   // ...
//   token, err := config.Exchange(ctx, ...)
//   driveactivityService, err := driveactivity.NewService(ctx, option.WithTokenSource(config.TokenSource(ctx, token)))
//
// See https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/option/ for details on options.
