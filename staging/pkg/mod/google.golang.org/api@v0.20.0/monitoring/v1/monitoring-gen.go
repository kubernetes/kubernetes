// Aggregation: Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide
// a different view of the data. Aggregation of time series is done in
// two steps. First, each time series in the set is aligned to the same
// time interval boundaries, then the set of time series is optionally
// reduced in number.Alignment consists of applying the
// per_series_aligner operation to each time series after its data has
// been divided into regular alignment_period time intervals. This
// process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies
// a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum,
// delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per
// period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can
// optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through
// similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a
// cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the
// time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the
// reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge
// amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction
// transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and
// representative collection of data, for example "the 95% latency
// across the average of all tasks in a cluster". This representative
// data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual
// time series data is still available for later drilldown. For more
// details, see Aggregating Time Series.
