In the first example, the report returns each edited document's doc_id. In the second example, the report returns each viewed document's doc_id that equals the value 12345 and does not return any viewed document's which have a doc_id value of 98765. The \u003c\u003e operator is URL-encoded in the request's query string (%3C%3E):\n\nGET...\u0026eventName=edit\u0026filters=doc_id GET...\u0026eventName=view\u0026filters=doc_id==12345,doc_id%3C%3E98765\n\nThe relational operators include:  \n- == - 'equal to'. \n- \u003c\u003e - 'not equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3C%3E). \n- \u003c - 'less than'. It is URL-encoded (%3C). \n- \u003c= - 'less than or equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3C=). \n- \u003e - 'greater than'. It is URL-encoded (%3E). \n- \u003e= - 'greater than or equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3E=).  \nNote: The API doesn't accept multiple values of a parameter. If a particular parameter is supplied more than once in the API request, the API only accepts the last value of that request parameter.\nIn addition, if an invalid request parameter is supplied in the API request, the API ignores that request parameter and returns the response corresponding to the remaining valid request parameters.
