// # Transactions
//
//
// Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
// active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
// re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
// new session for each transaction.
//
// # Transaction Modes
//
// Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
//
//   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
//      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
//      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
//      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
//      application to retry.
//
//   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
//      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
//      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
//      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
//      transactions do not need to be committed.
//
//   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
//      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
//      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
//      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
//      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
//      committed.
//
// For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
// provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
// particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
// not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
// taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
//
// Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
// may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
// database.
//
// ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
//
// Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
// data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
// consistent.
//
// Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
// is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
// and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
// active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
// transaction has not been terminated by
// [Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit] or
// [Rollback][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Rollback].  Long periods of
// inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
// transaction's locks and abort it.
//
// Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
// reads or SQL statements followed by
// [Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit]. At any time before
// [Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit], the client can send a
// [Rollback][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Rollback] request to abort the
// transaction.
//
// ### Semantics
//
// Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
// are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
// locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
// reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
// that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
//
// Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
// how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
// use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
// between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
//
// ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
//
// When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
// whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
// committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
// same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
// priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
// attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
//
// Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
// modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
// short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
// idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
// instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
// retrying.
//
// ### Idle Transactions
//
// A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
// SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
// seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
// don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
// fail with error `ABORTED`.
//
// If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
// SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
// transaction from becoming idle.
//
// ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
//
// Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
// locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
// reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
//
// Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
// choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
// timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
// concurrent read-write transactions.
//
// Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
// transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
// timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
// collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
// need to worry about this in practice.
//
// Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
// [Commit][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Commit] or
// [Rollback][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.Rollback] (and in fact are not
// permitted to do so).
//
// To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
// bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
//
// The types of timestamp bound are:
//
//   - Strong (the default).
//   - Bounded staleness.
//   - Exact staleness.
//
// If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
// stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
// or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
// from the leader replica.
//
// Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
//
// ### Strong
//
// Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
// that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
// rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
// any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
// see the transaction.
//
// Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
// transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
// concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
// reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
// timestamp.
//
// See [TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong].
//
// ### Exact Staleness
//
// These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
// timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
// prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
// modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
// the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
// transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
// all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
// <= the read timestamp have finished.
//
// The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
// timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
//
// These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
// timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
// equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
// boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
//
// See [TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp] and
// [TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness].
//
// ### Bounded Staleness
//
// Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
// subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
// newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
// of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
//
// All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
// the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
// transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
// reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
// different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
//
// Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
// negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
// read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
// timestamp.
//
// As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
// usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
// reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
// results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
//
// Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
// which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
// read-only transactions.
//
// See [TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness] and
// [TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp][google.spanner.v1.TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp].
//
// ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
//
// Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
// in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
// as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
// are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
// at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
// restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
// timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
// too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
//
// ## Partitioned DML Transactions
//
// Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
// different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
// scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
// ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
// should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
//
// Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
// partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
// automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
//
// To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
// on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
// smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
//
// That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
// in ReadWrite transactions.
//
//  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
//    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
//    a single row of the table.
//
//  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
//    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
//    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
//    with the base table rows.
//
//  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
//    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
//    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
//    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
//    dangerous to run a statement such as
//    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
//    against some rows.
//
//  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
//    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
//    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
//    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
//    never executed against other rows.
//
//  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
//    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
//
//  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
//    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
//    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
//    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
//    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
//    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
//
// Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
// operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
// table.
