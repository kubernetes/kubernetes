// Package lexruntimeservice provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Lex Runtime Service.
//
// Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint provides
// a set of operations (API). Your conversational bot uses the runtime API to
// understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For example, suppose
// a user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to Amazon Lex using
// the runtime API. Amazon Lex recognizes that the user request is for the OrderPizza
// intent (one of the intents defined in the bot). Then Amazon Lex engages in
// user conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit required information (slot
// values, such as pizza size and crust type), and then performs fulfillment
// activity (that you configured when you created the bot). You use the build-time
// API to create and manage your Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations,
// see the build-time API, .

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Lex Runtime Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
