// Package codepipeline provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS CodePipeline.
//
// Overview
//
// This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions
// of the actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some functionality for
// your pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more information,
// see the AWS CodePipeline User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html).
//
// You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions,
// and transitions.
//
// Pipelines are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely
// named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions.
//
// You can work with pipelines by calling:
//
//    * CreatePipeline, which creates a uniquely named pipeline.
//
//    * DeletePipeline, which deletes the specified pipeline.
//
//    * GetPipeline, which returns information about the pipeline structure
//    and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
//
//    * GetPipelineExecution, which returns information about a specific execution
//    of a pipeline.
//
//    * GetPipelineState, which returns information about the current state
//    of the stages and actions of a pipeline.
//
//    * ListActionExecutions, which returns action-level details for past executions.
//    The details include full stage and action-level details, including individual
//    action duration, status, any errors that occurred during the execution,
//    and input and output artifact location details.
//
//    * ListPipelines, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated
//    with your account.
//
//    * ListPipelineExecutions, which gets a summary of the most recent executions
//    for a pipeline.
//
//    * StartPipelineExecution, which runs the most recent revision of an artifact
//    through the pipeline.
//
//    * StopPipelineExecution, which stops the specified pipeline execution
//    from continuing through the pipeline.
//
//    * UpdatePipeline, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the
//    structure of the pipeline.
//
// Pipelines include stages. Each stage contains one or more actions that must
// complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure.
// If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until
// either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a
// user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline.
// You can call GetPipelineState, which displays the status of a pipeline, including
// the status of stages in the pipeline, or GetPipeline, which returns the entire
// structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more
// information about the structure of stages and actions, see AWS CodePipeline
// Pipeline Structure Reference (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html).
//
// Pipeline stages include actions that are categorized into categories such
// as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example,
// you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source
// such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in
// most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with
// pipeline operations such as CreatePipeline and GetPipelineState. Valid action
// categories are:
//
//    * Source
//
//    * Build
//
//    * Test
//
//    * Deploy
//
//    * Approval
//
//    * Invoke
//
// Pipelines also include transitions, which allow the transition of artifacts
// from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage complete.
//
// You can work with transitions by calling:
//
//    * DisableStageTransition, which prevents artifacts from transitioning
//    to the next stage in a pipeline.
//
//    * EnableStageTransition, which enables transition of artifacts between
//    stages in a pipeline.
//
// Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline
//
// For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations
// with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API
// user. To integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers need to work with the
// following items:
//
// Jobs, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action
// might import a revision of an artifact from a source.
//
// You can work with jobs by calling:
//
//    * AcknowledgeJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the
//    specified job.
//
//    * GetJobDetails, which returns the details of a job.
//
//    * PollForJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on.
//
//    * PutJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure.
//
//    * PutJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success.
//
// Third party jobs, which are instances of an action created by a partner action
// and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members
// of the AWS Partner Network.
//
// You can work with third party jobs by calling:
//
//    * AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received
//    the specified job.
//
//    * GetThirdPartyJobDetails, which requests the details of a job for a partner
//    action.
//
//    * PollForThirdPartyJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to
//    act on.
//
//    * PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure.
//
//    * PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success.

// To contact AWS CodePipeline with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
