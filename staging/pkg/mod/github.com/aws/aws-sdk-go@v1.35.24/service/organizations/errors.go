	// limit:
	//
	// Some of the reasons in the following list might not be applicable to this
	// specific API or operation.
	//
	//    * ACCOUNT_CANNOT_LEAVE_ORGANIZAION: You attempted to remove the management
	//    account from the organization. You can't remove the management account.
	//    Instead, after you remove all member accounts, delete the organization
	//    itself.
	//
	//    * ACCOUNT_CANNOT_LEAVE_WITHOUT_EULA: You attempted to remove an account
	//    from the organization that doesn't yet have enough information to exist
	//    as a standalone account. This account requires you to first agree to the
	//    AWS Customer Agreement. Follow the steps at Removing a member account
	//    from your organization (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#orgs_manage_accounts_remove-from-master)in
	//    the AWS Organizations User Guide.
	//
	//    * ACCOUNT_CANNOT_LEAVE_WITHOUT_PHONE_VERIFICATION: You attempted to remove
	//    an account from the organization that doesn't yet have enough information
	//    to exist as a standalone account. This account requires you to first complete
	//    phone verification. Follow the steps at Removing a member account from
	//    your organization (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#orgs_manage_accounts_remove-from-master)
	//    in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
	//
	//    * ACCOUNT_CREATION_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the number
	//    of accounts that you can create in one day.
	//
	//    * ACCOUNT_NUMBER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the limit on
	//    the number of accounts in an organization. If you need more accounts,
	//    contact AWS Support (https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/) to
	//    request an increase in your limit. Or the number of invitations that you
	//    tried to send would cause you to exceed the limit of accounts in your
	//    organization. Send fewer invitations or contact AWS Support to request
	//    an increase in the number of accounts. Deleted and closed accounts still
	//    count toward your limit. If you get this exception when running a command
	//    immediately after creating the organization, wait one hour and try again.
	//    After an hour, if the command continues to fail with this error, contact
	//    AWS Support (https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).
	//
	//    * CANNOT_REGISTER_MASTER_AS_DELEGATED_ADMINISTRATOR: You attempted to
	//    register the management account of the organization as a delegated administrator
	//    for an AWS service integrated with Organizations. You can designate only
	//    a member account as a delegated administrator.
	//
	//    * CANNOT_REMOVE_DELEGATED_ADMINISTRATOR_FROM_ORG: You attempted to remove
	//    an account that is registered as a delegated administrator for a service
	//    integrated with your organization. To complete this operation, you must
	//    first deregister this account as a delegated administrator.
	//
	//    * CREATE_ORGANIZATION_IN_BILLING_MODE_UNSUPPORTED_REGION: To create an
	//    organization in the specified region, you must enable all features mode.
	//
	//    * DELEGATED_ADMINISTRATOR_EXISTS_FOR_THIS_SERVICE: You attempted to register
	//    an AWS account as a delegated administrator for an AWS service that already
	//    has a delegated administrator. To complete this operation, you must first
	//    deregister any existing delegated administrators for this service.
	//
	//    * EMAIL_VERIFICATION_CODE_EXPIRED: The email verification code is only
	//    valid for a limited period of time. You must resubmit the request and
	//    generate a new verfication code.
	//
	//    * HANDSHAKE_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the number of
	//    handshakes that you can send in one day.
	//
	//    * MASTER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_DOES_NOT_MATCH_MARKETPLACE: To create an account
	//    in this organization, you first must migrate the organization's management
	//    account to the marketplace that corresponds to the management account's
	//    address. For example, accounts with India addresses must be associated
	//    with the AISPL marketplace. All accounts in an organization must be associated
	//    with the same marketplace.
	//
	//    * MASTER_ACCOUNT_MISSING_BUSINESS_LICENSE: Applies only to the AWS Regions
	//    in China. To create an organization, the master must have an valid business
	//    license. For more information, contact customer support.
	//
	//    * MASTER_ACCOUNT_MISSING_CONTACT_INFO: To complete this operation, you
	//    must first provide a valid contact address and phone number for the management
	//    account. Then try the operation again.
	//
	//    * MASTER_ACCOUNT_NOT_GOVCLOUD_ENABLED: To complete this operation, the
	//    management account must have an associated account in the AWS GovCloud
	//    (US-West) Region. For more information, see AWS Organizations (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html)
	//    in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.
	//
	//    * MASTER_ACCOUNT_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT_REQUIRED: To create an organization
	//    with this management account, you first must associate a valid payment
	//    instrument, such as a credit card, with the account. Follow the steps
	//    at To leave an organization when all required account information has
	//    not yet been provided (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info)
	//    in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
	//
	//    * MAX_DELEGATED_ADMINISTRATORS_FOR_SERVICE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted
	//    to register more delegated administrators than allowed for the service
	//    principal.
	//
	//    * MAX_POLICY_TYPE_ATTACHMENT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the
	//    number of policies of a certain type that can be attached to an entity
	//    at one time.
	//
	//    * MAX_TAG_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You have exceeded the number of tags allowed
	//    on this resource.
	//
	//    * MEMBER_ACCOUNT_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT_REQUIRED: To complete this operation
	//    with this member account, you first must associate a valid payment instrument,
	//    such as a credit card, with the account. Follow the steps at To leave
	//    an organization when all required account information has not yet been
	//    provided (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info)
	//    in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
	//
	//    * MIN_POLICY_TYPE_ATTACHMENT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to detach a
	//    policy from an entity that would cause the entity to have fewer than the
	//    minimum number of policies of a certain type required.
	//
	//    * ORGANIZATION_NOT_IN_ALL_FEATURES_MODE: You attempted to perform an operation
	//    that requires the organization to be configured to support all features.
	//    An organization that supports only consolidated billing features can't
	//    perform this operation.
	//
	//    * OU_DEPTH_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to create an OU tree that is
	//    too many levels deep.
	//
	//    * OU_NUMBER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the number of OUs
