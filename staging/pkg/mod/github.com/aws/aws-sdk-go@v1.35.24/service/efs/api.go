// Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token
// in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling
// the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system does
// not currently exist that is owned by the caller's AWS account with the specified
// creation token, this operation does the following:
//
//    * Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon
//    EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state creating.
//
//    * Returns with the description of the created file system.
//
// Otherwise, this operation returns a FileSystemAlreadyExists error with the
// ID of the existing file system.
//
// For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the creation
// token.
//
// The idempotent operation allows you to retry a CreateFileSystem call without
// risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call
// fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was
// actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout occurred
// or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same creation token,
// if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file system, the client can
// learn of its existence from the FileSystemAlreadyExists error.
//
// The CreateFileSystem call returns while the file system's lifecycle state
// is still creating. You can check the file system creation status by calling
// the DescribeFileSystems operation, which among other things returns the file
// system state.
//
// This operation also takes an optional PerformanceMode parameter that you
// choose for your file system. We recommend generalPurpose performance mode
// for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO performance mode can
// scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second
// with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The
// performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created.
// For more information, see Amazon EFS: Performance Modes (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html).
//
// After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state
// to available, at which point you can create one or more mount targets for
// the file system in your VPC. For more information, see CreateMountTarget.
// You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC by

// CreateMountTarget API operation for Amazon Elastic File System.

// Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file system
// on EC2 instances by using the mount target.
//
// You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC. All
// EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a single mount
// target for a given file system. If you have multiple subnets in an Availability
// Zone, you create a mount target in one of the subnets. EC2 instances do not
// need to be in the same subnet as the mount target in order to access their
// file system. For more information, see Amazon EFS: How it Works (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html).
//
// In the request, you also specify a file system ID for which you are creating
// the mount target and the file system's lifecycle state must be available.
// For more information, see DescribeFileSystems.
//
// In the request, you also provide a subnet ID, which determines the following:
//
//    * VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
//
//    * Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target
//
//    * IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the
//    mount target (if you don't specify an IP address in the request)
//
// After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that includes,
// a MountTargetId and an IpAddress. You use this IP address when mounting the
// file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount target's DNS name
// when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on which you mount the file
// system by using the mount target can resolve the mount target's DNS name
// to its IP address. For more information, see How it Works: Implementation
// Overview (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation).
//
// Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC,
// and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if
// the file system already has one or more mount targets created for it, the
// subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must meet the
// following requirements:
//
//    * Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount targets
//
//    * Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of the
//    existing mount targets
//
// If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the following:
//
//    * Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.
//
//    * Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows: If the
//    request provides an IpAddress, Amazon EFS assigns that IP address to the
//    network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the
//    subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2 CreateNetworkInterface call
//    does when a request does not specify a primary private IP address). If
//    the request provides SecurityGroups, this network interface is associated
//    with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security
//    group for the subnet's VPC. Assigns the description Mount target fsmt-id
//    for file system fs-id where fsmt-id is the mount target ID, and fs-id
//    is the FileSystemId. Sets the requesterManaged property of the network
//    interface to true, and the requesterId value to EFS. Each Amazon EFS mount
//    target has one corresponding requester-managed EC2 network interface.
//    After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets the NetworkInterfaceId
//    field in the mount target's description to the network interface ID, and
//    the IpAddress field to its address. If network interface creation fails,
//    the entire CreateMountTarget operation fails.
//
// The CreateMountTarget call returns only after creating the network interface,
// but while the mount target state is still creating, you can check the mount
// target creation status by calling the DescribeMountTargets operation, which
// among other things returns the mount target state.
//
// We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones.
// There are cost considerations for using a file system in an Availability
// Zone through a mount target created in another Availability Zone. For more
// information, see Amazon EFS (http://aws.amazon.com/efs/). In addition, by
// always using a mount target local to the instance's Availability Zone, you
// eliminate a partial failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which your
// mount target is created goes down, then you can't access your file system
// through that mount target.
//
// This operation requires permissions for the following action on the file
// system:
//
//    * elasticfilesystem:CreateMountTarget
//
// This operation also requires permissions for the following Amazon EC2 actions:
//
//    * ec2:DescribeSubnets
//
//    * ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces
//
//    * ec2:CreateNetworkInterface
