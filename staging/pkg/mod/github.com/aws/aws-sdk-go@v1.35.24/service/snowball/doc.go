//
// AWS Snow Family is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
// devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data centers
// and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snow commands described
// here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS
// Snow Family Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs
// for a Snow device. To transfer data locally with a Snow device, you'll need
// to use the Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball
// or AWS OpsHub for Snow Family. For more information, see the User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/snowball-2016-06-30 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Import/Export Snowball with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
