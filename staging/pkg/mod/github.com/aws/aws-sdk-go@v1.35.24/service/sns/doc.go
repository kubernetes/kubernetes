// Package sns provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Simple Notification Service.
//
// Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables
// you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon
// SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers
// over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product
// see https://aws.amazon.com/sns (http://aws.amazon.com/sns/). For detailed
// information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see
// the Amazon SNS Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/).
//
// We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred
// programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes
// care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying
// requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go
// to Tools for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/sns-2010-03-31 for more information on this service.
//
// See sns package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Simple Notification Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
