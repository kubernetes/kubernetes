//
// AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud.
// Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers
// to access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated
// heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS
// Batch will be familiar to users of traditional batch computing software.
// This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted
// in order to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver
// results quickly.
//
// As a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and
// engineers to run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically
// provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based
// on the quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch, there is no need
// to install or manage batch computing software, which allows you to focus
// on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch reduces operational
// complexities, saves time, and reduces costs, which makes it easy for developers,
// scientists, and engineers to run their batch jobs in the AWS Cloud.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Batch with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
