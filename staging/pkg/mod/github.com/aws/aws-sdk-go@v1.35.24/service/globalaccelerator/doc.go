// Package globalaccelerator provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Global Accelerator.
//
// This is the AWS Global Accelerator API Reference. This guide is for developers
// who need detailed information about AWS Global Accelerator API actions, data
// types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features,
// see the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/Welcome.html).
//
// AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve
// availability and performance of your applications for local and global users.
// Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global
// network. This improves the availability and performance of your internet
// applications that are used by a global audience. Global Accelerator is a
// global service that supports endpoints in multiple AWS Regions, which are
// listed in the AWS Region Table (https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).
//
// Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple
// AWS Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create or
// update accelerators.
//
// By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that
// you associate with your accelerator. (Instead of using the IP addresses that
// Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4
// addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator.)
// The static IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge network and distribute
// incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple
// AWS Regions, which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints
// can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, EC2 instances,
// or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one AWS Region or multiple Regions.
//
// Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal
// regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you
// configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration
// to ensure that internet traffic from clients is directed to only healthy
// endpoints.
//
// Global Accelerator includes components that work together to help you improve
// performance and availability for your applications:
//
// Static IP address
//
// By default, AWS Global Accelerator provides you with a set of static IP addresses
// that are anycast from the AWS edge network and serve as the single fixed
// entry points for your clients. Or you can configure these entry points to
// be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global
// Accelerator (BYOIP). For more information, see Bring Your Own IP Addresses
// (BYOIP) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html)
// in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide. If you already have load balancers,
// EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses set up for your applications, you
// can easily add those to Global Accelerator to allow the resources to be accessed
// by the static IP addresses.
//
// The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as
// it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or
// routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose the static
// IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic
// by using them. You can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit
// the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information,
// see Authentication and Access Control (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/auth-and-access-control.html)
// in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.
//
// Accelerator
//
// An accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network
// to improve availability and performance for your internet applications that
// have a global audience. Each accelerator includes one or more listeners.
//
// DNS name
//
// Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System
// (DNS) name, similar to a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com, that points
// to your Global Accelerator static IP addresses. Depending on the use case,
// you can use your accelerator's static IP addresses or DNS name to route traffic
// to your accelerator, or set up DNS records to route traffic using your own
// custom domain name.
//
// Network zone
//
// A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from
// a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is
// an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure
// an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses
// for it. If one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to
// IP address blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then
// client applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other
// isolated network zone.
//
// Listener
//
// A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator,
// based on the protocol and port that you configure. Each listener has one
// or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints
// in one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying
// the Regions that you want to distribute traffic to. Traffic is distributed
// to optimal endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with a listener.
//
// Endpoint group
//
// Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups
// include one or more endpoints in the Region. You can increase or reduce the
// percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group
// by adjusting a setting called a traffic dial. The traffic dial lets you easily
// do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing for new releases
// across different AWS Regions, for example.
//
// Endpoint
//
// An endpoint is a Network Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, EC2 instance,
// or Elastic IP address. Traffic is routed to endpoints based on several factors,
// including the geo-proximity to the user, the health of the endpoint, and
// the configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For
// each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers that you can
// use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be
// useful, for example, to do performance testing within a Region.

// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Global Accelerator with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
