// Package transfer provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Transfer Family.
//
// AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer
// of files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over
// SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly
// into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). AWS helps you
// seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer Family by
// integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing
// with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners,
// or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with AWS
// services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting
// started with AWS Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure
// to buy and set up.

// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
