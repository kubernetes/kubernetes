// Package chime provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Chime.
//
// The Amazon Chime API (application programming interface) is designed for
// developers to perform key tasks, such as creating and managing Amazon Chime
// accounts, users, and Voice Connectors. This guide provides detailed information
// about the Amazon Chime API, including operations, types, inputs and outputs,
// and error codes. It also includes some server-side API actions to use with
// the Amazon Chime SDK. For more information about the Amazon Chime SDK, see
// Using the Amazon Chime SDK (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/meetings-sdk.html)
// in the Amazon Chime Developer Guide.
//
// You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the
// REST API to make API calls. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.
// Each API operation includes links to information about using it with a language-specific
// AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.
//
// Using an AWS SDK
//
// You don't need to write code to calculate a signature for request authentication.
// The SDK clients authenticate your requests by using access keys that you
// provide. For more information about AWS SDKs, see the AWS Developer Center
// (http://aws.amazon.com/developer/).
//
// Using the AWS CLI
//
// Use your access keys with the AWS CLI to make API calls. For information
// about setting up the AWS CLI, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface
// (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) in the
// AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. For a list of available Amazon Chime
// commands, see the Amazon Chime commands (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/chime/index.html)
// in the AWS CLI Command Reference.
//
// Using REST API
//
// If you use REST to make API calls, you must authenticate your request by
// providing a signature. Amazon Chime supports signature version 4. For more
// information, see Signature Version 4 Signing Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)
// in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
//
// When making REST API calls, use the service name chime and REST endpoint
// https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com.
//
// Administrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access Management
// (IAM). For more information, see Identity and Access Management for Amazon
// Chime (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/security-iam.html) in
// the Amazon Chime Administration Guide.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/chime-2018-05-01 for more information on this service.
//
// See chime package documentation for more information.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/chime/
//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Chime with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/#Config
//
// See the Amazon Chime client Chime for more
// information on creating client for this service.
