// Package directoryservice provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Directory Service.
//
// AWS Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup
// and run directories in the AWS cloud, or connect your AWS resources with
// an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This guide provides detailed
// information about AWS Directory Service operations, data types, parameters,
// and errors. For information about AWS Directory Services features, see AWS
// Directory Service (https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/) and the AWS
// Directory Service Administration Guide (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html).
//
// AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
// languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs
// provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Directory Service
// and other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including
// how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ds-2015-04-16 for more information on this service.

// See directoryservice package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Directory Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

//
// See the AWS Directory Service client DirectoryService for more
// information on creating client for this service.
