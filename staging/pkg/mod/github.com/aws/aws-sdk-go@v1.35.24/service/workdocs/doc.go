// Package workdocs provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon WorkDocs.
//
// The WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:
//
//    * File Migration: File migration applications are supported for users
//    who want to migrate their files from an on-premises or off-premises file
//    system or service. Users can insert files into a user directory structure,
//    as well as allow for basic metadata changes, such as modifications to
//    the permissions of files.
//
//    * Security: Support security applications are supported for users who
//    have additional security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention.
//    The API actions, along with AWS CloudTrail, allow these applications to
//    detect when changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can
//    take the necessary actions and replace the target file. If the target
//    file violates the policy, the application can also choose to email the
//    user.
//
//    * eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are supported,
//    such as eDiscovery and analytics. These applications can choose to mimic
//    or record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with AWS CloudTrail,
//    to replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical applications.
//
// All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed.
// They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive
// use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission
// policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon
// WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the
// entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes,
// but is not limited to, the ability to modify file permissions and upload
// any file to any user. This allows developers to perform the three use cases
// above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis
// using the IAM model.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon WorkDocs with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
