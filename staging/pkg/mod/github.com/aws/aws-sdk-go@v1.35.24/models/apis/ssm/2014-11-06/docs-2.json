  "service": "<fullname>AWS Systems Manager</fullname> <p>AWS Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as collecting system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. A <i>managed instance</i> is any Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance (EC2 instance), or any on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager.</p> <p>This reference is intended to be used with the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/\">AWS Systems Manager User Guide</a>.</p> <p>To get started, verify prerequisites and configure managed instances. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html\">Setting up AWS Systems Manager</a> in the <i>AWS Systems Manager User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For information about other API actions you can perform on EC2 instances, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/\">Amazon EC2 API Reference</a>.

  "operations": {
    "AddTagsToResource": "<p>Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents, managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. For example: Key=Owner and Value=DbAdmin, SysAdmin, or Dev. Or Key=Stack and Value=Production, Pre-Production, or Test.</p> <p>Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags. </p> <p>We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. </p> <p>For more information about using tags with EC2 instances, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html\">Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>",

    "CreateActivation": "<p>Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register your on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) with Systems Manager. Registering these machines with Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems Manager capabilities. You use the activation code and ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your hybrid environment. For more information about requirements for managing on-premises instances and VMs using Systems Manager, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html\">Setting up AWS Systems Manager for hybrid environments</a> in the <i>AWS Systems Manager User Guide</i>. </p> <note> <p>On-premises servers or VMs that are registered with Systems Manager and EC2 instances that you manage with Systems Manager are all called <i>managed instances</i>.</p> </note>",
    "CreateAssociation": "<p>A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain on your instances. For example, an association can specify that anti-virus software must be installed and running on your instances, or that certain ports must be closed. For static targets, the association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is reapplied. For dynamic targets, such as an AWS Resource Group or an AWS Autoscaling Group, State Manager applies the configuration when new instances are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software is not installed, then State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service is not running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service. </p>",
    "CreateAssociationBatch": "<p>Associates the specified Systems Manager document with the specified instances or targets.</p> <p>When you associate a document with one or more instances using instance IDs or tags, SSM Agent running on the instance processes the document and configures the instance as specified.</p> <p>If you associate a document with an instance that already has an associated document, the system returns the AssociationAlreadyExists exception.</p>",

    "CreateResourceDataSync": "<p>A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single location. Systems Manager offers two types of resource data sync: <code>SyncToDestination</code> and <code>SyncFromSource</code>.</p> <p>You can configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the <code>SyncToDestination</code> type to synchronize Inventory data from multiple AWS Regions to a single S3 bucket. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-datasync.html\">Configuring Resource Data Sync for Inventory</a> in the <i>AWS Systems Manager User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the <code>SyncFromSource</code> type to synchronize operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData) from multiple AWS Regions to a single S3 bucket. This type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData from multiple AWS accounts and Regions or <code>EntireOrganization</code> by using AWS Organizations. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/Explorer-resource-data-sync.html\">Setting up Systems Manager Explorer to display data from multiple accounts and Regions</a> in the <i>AWS Systems Manager User Guide</i>.</p> <p>A resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately. After a successful initial sync is completed, the system continuously syncs data. To check the status of a sync, use the <a>ListResourceDataSync</a>.</p> <note> <p>By default, data is not encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy. </p> </note>",

However, if you do not specify a tier in a request, Parameter Store assigns the tier based on the current Parameter Store default tier configuration.</p> <p>The default tier when you begin using Parameter Store is the standard-parameter tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you can specify one of the following as the default:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Advanced</b>: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates all requests as advanced parameters. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Intelligent-Tiering</b>: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates each request to determine if the parameter is standard or advanced. </p> <p>If the request doesn't include any options that require an advanced parameter, the parameter is created in the standard-parameter tier. If one or more options requiring an advanced parameter are included in the request, Parameter Store create a parameter in the advanced-parameter tier.</p> <p>This approach helps control your parameter-related costs by always creating standard parameters unless an advanced parameter is necessary. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Options that require an advanced parameter include the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The content size of the parameter is more than 4 KB.</p> </li> <li> <p>The parameter uses a parameter policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>More than 10,000 parameters already exist in your AWS account in the current Region.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about configuring the default tier option, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ps-default-tier.html\">Specifying a default parameter tier</a> in the <i>AWS Systems Manager User Guide</i>.</p>",
