For some top-level domains (TLDs), this operation requires extra parameters.</p> <p>When you register a domain, Amazon Route 53 does the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Creates a Route 53 hosted zone that has the same name as the domain. Route 53 assigns four name servers to your hosted zone and automatically updates your domain registration with the names of these name servers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enables autorenew, so your domain registration will renew automatically each year. We'll notify you in advance of the renewal date so you can choose whether to renew the registration.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optionally enables privacy protection, so WHOIS queries return contact information either for Amazon Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org domains) or for our registrar associate, Gandi (for all other TLDs).

    "RenewDomain": "<p>This operation renews a domain for the specified number of years.

Some registrars provide free DNS service when you purchase a domain registration. When you transfer the registration, the previous registrar will not renew your domain registration and could end your DNS service at any time.</p> <important> <p>If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the domain and you don't transfer DNS service to another provider, your website, email, and the web applications associated with the domain might become unavailable.</p> </important> <p>If the transfer is successful, this method returns an operation ID that you can use to track the progress and completion of the action.

    "TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount": "<p>Transfers a domain from the current AWS account to another AWS account. Note the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The AWS account that you're transferring the domain to must accept the transfer.
