  "service": "<fullname>AWS Key Management Service</fullname> <p>AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/\"> <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS.</p> <p>Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p> <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you <i>do not</i> use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests.</p> <p>All AWS KMS operations require <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/\">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html\">AWS Security Credentials</a> - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used for accessing AWS.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\">Temporary Security Credentials</a> - This section of the <i>IAM User Guide</i> describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a> - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Commonly Used API Operations</b> </p> <p>Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>Encrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>Decrypt</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKey</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time.</p> <p>To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html\">DescribeClusters</a> operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html\">CreateHsm</a> operation. Also, the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser\"> <code>kmsuser</code> crypto user</a> (CU) must not be logged into the cluster.

This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation.</p> <p>During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the <code>kmsuser</code> CU, and rotates its password.</p> <p>The <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation and see the <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code> in the response. For help interpreting the <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code>, see <a>CustomKeyStoresListEntry</a>.</p> <p>To fix the failure, use the <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the <a>UpdateCustomKeyStore</a> operation if necessary, and then use <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> again.</p> <p>If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html\">Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>",
    "CreateAlias": "<p>Creates a display name for a customer managed customer master key (CMK).

You can change the CMK associated with the alias at any time.</p> <p>Aliases are easier to remember than key IDs. They can also help to simplify your applications. For example, if you use an alias in your code, you can change the CMK your code uses by associating a given alias with a different CMK. </p> <p>To run the same code in multiple AWS regions, use an alias in your code, such as <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code>. Then, in each AWS Region, create an <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code> alias that is associated with a CMK in that Region. When you run your code, it uses the <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code> CMK for that AWS Region without any Region-specific code.</p> <p>This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you created, use the <a>ListAliases</a> operation.</p> <p>To use aliases successfully, be aware of the following information.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Each alias points to only one CMK at a time, although a single CMK can have multiple aliases. The alias and its associated CMK must be in the same AWS account and Region. </p> </li> <li> <p>You can associate an alias with any customer managed CMK in the same AWS account and Region. However, you do not have permission to associate an alias with an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk\">AWS managed CMK</a> or an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-owned-cmk\">AWS owned CMK</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p>To change the CMK associated with an alias, use the <a>UpdateAlias</a> operation. The current CMK and the new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric) and they must have the same key usage (<code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT</code> or <code>SIGN_VERIFY</code>). This restriction prevents cryptographic errors in code that uses aliases.</p> </li> <li> <p>The alias name must begin with <code>alias/</code> followed by a name, such as <code>alias/ExampleAlias</code>. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with <code>alias/aws/</code>. The <code>alias/aws/</code> prefix is reserved for <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk\">AWS managed CMKs</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p>The alias name must be unique within an AWS Region. However, you can use the same alias name in multiple Regions of the same AWS account. Each instance of the alias is associated with a CMK in its Region.</p> </li> <li> <p>After you create an alias, you cannot change its alias name. However, you can use the <a>DeleteAlias</a> operation to delete the alias and then create a new alias with the desired name.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can use an alias name or alias ARN to identify a CMK in AWS KMS <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations\">cryptographic operations</a> and in the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. However, you cannot use alias names or alias ARNs in API operations that manage CMKs, such as <a>DisableKey</a> or <a>GetKeyPolicy</a>. For information about the valid CMK identifiers for each AWS KMS API operation, see the descriptions of the <code>KeyId</code> parameter in the API operation documentation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. To get the aliases and alias ARNs of CMKs in each AWS account and Region, use the <a>ListAliases</a> operation.</p> <p>The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same CMK, such as to change the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context\">encryption context</a> of a ciphertext.</p> <p>The <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using an AWS KMS CMK in an AWS KMS operation, such as <a>Encrypt</a> or <a>GenerateDataKey</a>. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#asymmetric-cmks\">asymmetric CMK</a> outside of AWS KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/\">AWS Encryption SDK</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">Amazon S3 client-side encryption</a>. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS.</p> <p>When you use the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK, you must identify the <i>source CMK</i>, that is, the CMK that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is optional, but you can specify a source CMK even when the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK. This ensures that the ciphertext is decrypted only by using a particular CMK. If the CMK that you specify cannot decrypt the ciphertext, the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation fails.</p> </li> <li> <p>To reencrypt the data, you must specify the <i>destination CMK</i>, that is, the CMK that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. If the destination CMK is an asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the CMK.</p> <important> <p>When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.</p> <p>You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.</p> </important> </li> </ul> <p>Unlike other AWS KMS API operations, <code>ReEncrypt</code> callers must have two permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>kms:ReEncryptFrom</code> permission on the source CMK</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>kms:ReEncryptTo</code> permission on the destination CMK</p> </li> </ul> <p>To permit reencryption from or to a CMK, include the <code>\"kms:ReEncrypt*\"</code> permission in your <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html\">key policy</a>. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use the console to create a CMK. But you must include it manually when you create a CMK programmatically or when you use the <a>PutKeyPolicy</a> operation to set a key policy.</p> <p>The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

    "ScheduleKeyDeletion": "<p>Schedules the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). You may provide a waiting period, specified in days, before deletion occurs. If you do not provide a waiting period, the default period of 30 days is used. When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes to <code>PendingDeletion</code>. Before the waiting period ends, you can use <a>CancelKeyDeletion</a> to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK and all AWS KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.</p> <important> <p>Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable.
