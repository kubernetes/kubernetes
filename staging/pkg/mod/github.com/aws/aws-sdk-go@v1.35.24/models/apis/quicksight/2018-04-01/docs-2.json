Customizations that apply to a namespace always override customizations that apply to an AWS account. To find out which customizations apply, use the <code>DescribeAccountCustomization</code> API operation.</p> <p>Before you use the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> API operation to add a theme as the namespace default, make sure that you first share the theme with the namespace. If you don't share it with the namespace, the theme isn't visible to your users even if you make it the default theme. To check if the theme is shared, view the current permissions by using the <code> <a>DescribeThemePermissions</a> </code> API operation.

    "CreateNamespace": "<p>(Enterprise edition only) Creates a new namespace for you to use with Amazon QuickSight.</p> <p>A namespace allows you to isolate the QuickSight users and groups that are registered for that namespace. Users that access the namespace can share assets only with other users or groups in the same namespace. They can't see users and groups in other namespaces. You can create a namespace after your AWS account is subscribed to QuickSight. The namespace must be unique within the AWS account. By default, there is a limit of 100 namespaces per AWS account. To increase your limit, create a ticket with AWS Support. </p>",
    "CreateTemplate": "<p>Creates a template from an existing QuickSight analysis or template. You can use the resulting template to create a dashboard.</p> <p>A <i>template</i> is an entity in QuickSight that encapsulates the metadata required to create an analysis and that you can use to create s dashboard.

The analysis remains visible in the API until it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from it.</p> <p>An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the QuickSight console.

It has the potential to use all of the AWS Regions and AWS Services. When you subscribe to QuickSight, you choose one AWS Region to use as your home Region. That's where your free SPICE capacity is located. You can use QuickSight in any supported AWS Region. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>AWS Region</code> - In each AWS Region where you sign in to QuickSight at least once, QuickSight acts as a separate instance of the same service. If you have a user directory, it resides in us-east-1, which is the US East (N. Virginia). Generally speaking, these users have access to QuickSight in any AWS Region, unless they are constrained to a namespace. </p> <p>To run the command in a different AWS Region, you change your Region settings. If you're using the AWS CLI, you can use one of the following options:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-options.html\">command line options</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p>Use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html\">named profiles</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p>Run <code>aws configure</code> to change your default AWS Region.

For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html\">Configuring the AWS CLI</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <code>Namespace</code> - A QuickSight namespace is a partition that contains users and assets (data sources, datasets, dashboards, and so on). To access assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces, even if they are in the same AWS account and AWS Region.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Applied customizations</code> - Within an AWS Region, a set of QuickSight customizations can apply to an AWS account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an AWS account. All settings are isolated to a single AWS Region. To apply them in other AWS Regions, run the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> command in each AWS Region where you want to apply the same customizations. </p> </li> </ul>",
