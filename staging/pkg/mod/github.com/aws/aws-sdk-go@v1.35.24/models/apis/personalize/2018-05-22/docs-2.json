If your TPS increases beyond <code>minProvisionedTPS</code>, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below <code>minProvisionedTPS</code>, to maintain a 70% utilization. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions.
