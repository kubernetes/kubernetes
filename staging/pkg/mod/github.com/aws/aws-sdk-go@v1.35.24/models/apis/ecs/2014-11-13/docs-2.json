  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname> <p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage by using the EC2 launch type. For more information about launch types, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html\">Amazon ECS Launch Types</a>.</p> <p>Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.</p> <p>You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.</p>",

    "CreateCapacityProvider": "<p>Creates a new capacity provider. Capacity providers are associated with an Amazon ECS cluster and are used in capacity provider strategies to facilitate cluster auto scaling.</p> <p>Only capacity providers using an Auto Scaling group can be created. Amazon ECS tasks on AWS Fargate use the <code>FARGATE</code> and <code>FARGATE_SPOT</code> capacity providers which are already created and available to all accounts in Regions supported by AWS Fargate.</p>",
    "CreateCluster": "<p>Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a <code>default</code> cluster when you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the <code>CreateCluster</code> action.</p> <note> <p>When you call the <a>CreateCluster</a> API operation, Amazon ECS attempts to create the Amazon ECS service-linked role for your account so that required resources in other AWS services can be managed on your behalf. However, if the IAM user that makes the call does not have permissions to create the service-linked role, it is not created. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html\">Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note>",
    "CreateService": "<p>Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService action.</p> <p>In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html\">Service Load Balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance that they're hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.</p> <p>There are two service scheduler strategies available:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>REPLICA</code> - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html\">Service Scheduler Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DAEMON</code> - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html\">Service Scheduler Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation. The default value for a replica service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 0%.</p> <p>If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and they're reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.</p> <p>If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the <b>maximum percent</b> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PENDING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.</p> <p>If a service is using either the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the <b>minimum healthy percent</b> and <b>maximum percent</b> values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state while the container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used, although they're currently visible when describing your service.</p> <p>When creating a service that uses the <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the <a>CreateTaskSet</a> operation. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html\">Amazon ECS Deployment Types</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).</p> </li> <li> <p>By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy) with the <code>placementStrategy</code> parameter):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>",

If the launch type, load balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, you should create a new task set. For more information, see <a>CreateTaskSet</a>.</p> <p>You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new <code>desiredCount</code> parameter.</p> <p>If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy.</p> <note> <p>If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, <code>my_image:latest</code>), you do not need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the <code>forceNewDeployment</code> option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start.</p> </note> <p>You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and <code>maximumPercent</code>, to determine the deployment strategy.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore <code>desiredCount</code> temporarily during a deployment. For example, if <code>desiredCount</code> is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if <code>desiredCount</code> is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).</p> </li> </ul> <p>When <a>UpdateService</a> stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of <code>docker stop</code> is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a <code>SIGTERM</code> and a 30-second timeout, after which <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the <code>SIGTERM</code> gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent.</p> <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).</p> </li> <li> <p>By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy):</p> <ul> <li> <p>Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul>",

However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units.</p> <p>On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers.

The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter is not required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions.
