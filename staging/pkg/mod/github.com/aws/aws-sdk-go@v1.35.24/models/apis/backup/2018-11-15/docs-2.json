    "CreateBackupSelection": "<p>Creates a JSON document that specifies a set of resources to assign to a backup plan. Resources can be included by specifying patterns for a <code>ListOfTags</code> and selected <code>Resources</code>. </p> <p>For example, consider the following patterns:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Resources: \"arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:volume/volume-id\"</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ConditionKey:\"department\"</code> </p> <p> <code>ConditionValue:\"finance\"</code> </p> <p> <code>ConditionType:\"StringEquals\"</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ConditionKey:\"importance\"</code> </p> <p> <code>ConditionValue:\"critical\"</code> </p> <p> <code>ConditionType:\"StringEquals\"</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>Using these patterns would back up all Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are tagged as <code>\"department=finance\"</code>, <code>\"importance=critical\"</code>, in addition to an EBS volume with the specified volume ID.</p> <p>Resources and conditions are additive in that all resources that match the pattern are selected.
