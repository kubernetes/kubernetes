    "AddPermission": "<p>Grants an AWS service or another account permission to use a function. You can apply the policy at the function level, or specify a qualifier to restrict access to a single version or alias. If you use a qualifier, the invoker must use the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of that version or alias to invoke the function.</p> <p>To grant permission to another account, specify the account ID as the <code>Principal</code>. For AWS services, the principal is a domain-style identifier defined by the service, like <code>s3.amazonaws.com</code> or <code>sns.amazonaws.com</code>. For AWS services, you can also specify the ARN of the associated resource as the <code>SourceArn</code>. If you grant permission to a service principal without specifying the source, other accounts could potentially configure resources in their account to invoke your Lambda function.</p> <p>This action adds a statement to a resource-based permissions policy for the function.

    "CreateFunction": "<p>Creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deployment-package-v2.html\">deployment package</a> and an <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role\">execution role</a>. The deployment package contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and AWS X-Ray for request tracing.</p> <p>When you create a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a minute or so. During this time, you can't invoke or modify the function. The <code>State</code>, <code>StateReason</code>, and <code>StateReasonCode</code> fields in the response from <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the function is ready to invoke. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html\">Function States</a>.</p> <p>A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration. A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed to map to a different version. Use the <code>Publish</code> parameter to create version <code>1</code> of your function from its initial configuration.</p> <p>The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify version-specific settings later with <a>UpdateFunctionConfiguration</a>. Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the function, and include tags (<a>TagResource</a>) and per-function concurrency limits (<a>PutFunctionConcurrency</a>).</p> <p>If another account or an AWS service invokes your function, use <a>AddPermission</a> to grant permission by creating a resource-based IAM policy. You can grant permissions at the function level, on a version, or on an alias.</p> <p>To invoke your function directly, use <a>Invoke</a>. To invoke your function in response to events in other AWS services, create an event source mapping (<a>CreateEventSourceMapping</a>), or configure a function trigger in the other service.

    "Invoke": "<p>Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and wait for the response), or asynchronously. To invoke a function asynchronously, set <code>InvocationType</code> to <code>Event</code>.</p> <p>For <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-sync.html\">synchronous invocation</a>, details about the function response, including errors, are included in the response body and headers. For either invocation type, you can find more information in the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions.html\">execution log</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-x-ray.html\">trace</a>.</p> <p>When an error occurs, your function may be invoked multiple times. Retry behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and invocation type. For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously and it returns an error, Lambda executes the function up to two more times. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/retries-on-errors.html\">Retry Behavior</a>.</p> <p>For <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html\">asynchronous invocation</a>, Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to your function. If your function does not have enough capacity to keep up with the queue, events may be lost. Occasionally, your function may receive the same event multiple times, even if no error occurs. To retain events that were not processed, configure your function with a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#dlq\">dead-letter queue</a>.</p> <p>The status code in the API response doesn't reflect function errors. Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your function from executing, such as permissions errors, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html\">limit errors</a>, or issues with your function's code and configuration. For example, Lambda returns <code>TooManyRequestsException</code> if executing the function would cause you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level (<code>ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>) or function level (<code>ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>).</p> <p>For functions with a long timeout, your client might be disconnected during synchronous invocation while it waits for a response. Configure your HTTP client, SDK, firewall, proxy, or operating system to allow for long connections with timeout or keep-alive settings.</p> <p>This operation requires permission for the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_awslambda.html\">lambda:InvokeFunction</a> action.</p>",

To set one option without affecting existing settings for other options, use <a>UpdateFunctionEventInvokeConfig</a>.</p> <p>By default, Lambda retries an asynchronous invocation twice if the function returns an error. It retains events in a queue for up to six hours. When an event fails all processing attempts or stays in the asynchronous invocation queue for too long, Lambda discards it. To retain discarded events, configure a dead-letter queue with <a>UpdateFunctionConfiguration</a>.</p> <p>To send an invocation record to a queue, topic, function, or event bus, specify a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-async-destinations\">destination</a>.
