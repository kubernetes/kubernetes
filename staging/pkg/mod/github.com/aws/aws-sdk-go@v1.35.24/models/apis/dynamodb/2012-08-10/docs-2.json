DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.</p> <p>With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the AWS Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics.</p> <p>DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS region, providing built-in high availability and data durability. </p>",
  "operations": {
    "BatchGetItem": "<p>The <code>BatchGetItem</code> operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key.</p> <p>A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. <code>BatchGetItem</code> returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for <code>UnprocessedKeys</code>. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get.</p> <important> <p>If you request more than 100 items, <code>BatchGetItem</code> returns a <code>ValidationException</code> with the message \"Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call.\"</p> </important> <p>For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate <code>UnprocessedKeys</code> value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset.</p> <p>If <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then <code>BatchGetItem</code> returns a <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If <i>at least one</i> of the items is successfully processed, then <code>BatchGetItem</code> completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in <code>UnprocessedKeys</code>.</p> <important> <p>If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, <i>we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm</i>. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#BatchOperations\">Batch Operations and Error Handling</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> </important> <p>By default, <code>BatchGetItem</code> performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set <code>ConsistentRead</code> to <code>true</code> for any or all tables.</p> <p>In order to minimize response latency, <code>BatchGetItem</code> retrieves items in parallel.</p> <p>When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the <code>ProjectionExpression</code> parameter.</p> <p>If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read.

    "BatchWriteItem": "<p>The <code>BatchWriteItem</code> operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to <code>BatchWriteItem</code> can write up to 16 MB of data, which can comprise as many as 25 put or delete requests. Individual items to be written can be as large as 400 KB.</p> <note> <p> <code>BatchWriteItem</code> cannot update items. To update items, use the <code>UpdateItem</code> action.</p> </note> <p>The individual <code>PutItem</code> and <code>DeleteItem</code> operations specified in <code>BatchWriteItem</code> are atomic; however <code>BatchWriteItem</code> as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the <code>UnprocessedItems</code> response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call <code>BatchWriteItem</code> in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.</p> <p>If <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then <code>BatchWriteItem</code> returns a <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>.</p> <important> <p>If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, <i>we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm</i>. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#Programming.Errors.BatchOperations\">Batch Operations and Error Handling</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> </important> <p>With <code>BatchWriteItem</code>, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, <code>BatchWriteItem</code> does not behave in the same way as individual <code>PutItem</code> and <code>DeleteItem</code> calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and <code>BatchWriteItem</code> does not return deleted items in the response.</p> <p>If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, <code>BatchWriteItem</code> performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application.</p> <p>Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit.</p> <p>If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>One or more tables specified in the <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request does not exist.</p> </li> <li> <p>Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.</p> </li> <li> <p>You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request. </p> </li> <li> <p> Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys (which essentially is two put operations). </p> </li> <li> <p>There are more than 25 requests in the batch.</p> </li> <li> <p>Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.</p> </li> <li> <p>The total request size exceeds 16 MB.</p> </li> </ul>",

If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DELETE</code> - If no value is specified, the attribute and its value are removed from the item. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type.</p> <p>If a <i>set</i> of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[a,b,c]</code> and the <code>DELETE</code> action specified <code>[a,c]</code>, then the final attribute value would be <code>[b]</code>. Specifying an empty set is an error.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ADD</code> - If the attribute does not already exist, then the attribute and its values are added to the item. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of <code>ADD</code> depends on the data type of the attribute:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the existing attribute is a number, and if <code>Value</code> is also a number, then the <code>Value</code> is mathematically added to the existing attribute.

For example, suppose that the item you want to update does not yet have an attribute named <i>itemcount</i>, but you decide to <code>ADD</code> the number <code>3</code> to this attribute anyway, even though it currently does not exist. DynamoDB will create the <i>itemcount</i> attribute, set its initial value to <code>0</code>, and finally add <code>3</code> to it. The result will be a new <i>itemcount</i> attribute in the item, with a value of <code>3</code>.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p>If the existing data type is a set, and if the <code>Value</code> is also a set, then the <code>Value</code> is added to the existing set.

For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the <code>Value</code> must also be a set of strings. The same holds true for number sets and binary sets.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is number or is a set. Do not use <code>ADD</code> for any other data types.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>If no item with the specified <i>Key</i> is found:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>PUT</code> - DynamoDB creates a new item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DELETE</code> - Nothing happens; there is no attribute to delete.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>ADD</code> - DynamoDB creates an item with the supplied primary key and number (or set of numbers) for the attribute value.

If any of these attributes already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You can also use <code>SET</code> to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: <code>SET myNum = myNum + :val</code> </p> <p> <code>SET</code> supports the following functions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>if_not_exists (path, operand)</code> - if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then <code>if_not_exists</code> evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>list_append (operand, operand)</code> - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it.

If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of <code>ADD</code> depends on the data type of the attribute:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the existing attribute is a number, and if <code>Value</code> is also a number, then <code>Value</code> is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If <code>Value</code> is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.</p> <note> <p>If you use <code>ADD</code> to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value.</p> <p>Similarly, if you use <code>ADD</code> for an existing item to increment or decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update doesn't have an attribute named <code>itemcount</code>, but you decide to <code>ADD</code> the number <code>3</code> to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the <code>itemcount</code> attribute, set its initial value to <code>0</code>, and finally add <code>3</code> to it. The result will be a new <code>itemcount</code> attribute in the item, with a value of <code>3</code>.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p>If the existing data type is a set and if <code>Value</code> is also a set, then <code>Value</code> is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set <code>[1,2]</code>, and the <code>ADD</code> action specified <code>[3]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[1,2,3]</code>. An error occurs if an <code>ADD</code> action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. </p> <p>Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the <code>Value</code> must also be a set of strings.</p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>The <code>ADD</code> action only supports Number and set data types. In addition, <code>ADD</code> can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.</p> </important> </li> <li> <p> <code>DELETE</code> - Deletes an element from a set.</p> <p>If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[a,b,c]</code> and the <code>DELETE</code> action specifies <code>[a,c]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[b]</code>. Specifying an empty set is an error.</p> <important> <p>The <code>DELETE</code> action only supports set data types. In addition, <code>DELETE</code> can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.</p> </important> </li> </ul> <p>You can have many actions in a single expression, such as the following: <code>SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5</code> </p> <p>For more information on update expressions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.Modifying.html\">Modifying Items and Attributes</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p>"
