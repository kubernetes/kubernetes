For each layer, AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs a set of standard recipes for each event. You can also provide custom recipes for any or all layers and events. AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs custom event recipes after the standard recipes. <code>LayerCustomRecipes</code> specifies the custom recipes for a particular layer to be run in response to each of the five events.</p> <p>To specify a recipe, use the cookbook's directory name in the repository followed by two colons and the recipe name, which is the recipe's file name without the <code>.rb</code> extension. For example: <code>phpapp2::dbsetup</code> specifies the <code>dbsetup.rb</code> recipe in the repository's <code>phpapp2</code> folder.</p>",

In this case, the actual API endpoint of the stack is in <code>us-east-1</code>. Only the preceding regions are supported as classic regions in the <code>us-east-1</code> API endpoint. Because it is a best practice to choose the regional endpoint that is closest to where you manage AWS, we recommend that you use regional endpoints for new stacks.
