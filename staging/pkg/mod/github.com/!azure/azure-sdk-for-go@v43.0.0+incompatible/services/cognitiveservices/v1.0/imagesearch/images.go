// Details sends the details request.
// Parameters:
// query - the user's search query term. The term cannot be empty. The term may contain [Bing Advanced
// Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example, to limit images to a specific
// domain, use the [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator. To help improve relevance
// of an insights query (see
// [insightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#insightstoken)),
// you should always include the user's query term. Use this parameter only with the Image Search API.Do not
// specify this parameter when calling the Trending Images API.
// acceptLanguage - a comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user interface strings. The list
// is in decreasing order of preference. For additional information, including expected format, see
// [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This header and the
// [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
// query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify
// the [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc) query
// parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses the first supported language it finds
// from the list and combines it with the cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported
// language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses an aggregated or
// default market for the results. To determine the market that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use
// this header and the cc query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
// [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt) and
// [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#setlang)
// query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are
// few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response
// objects apply the specified language.
// contentType - optional request header. If you set the
// [modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#modulesrequested)
// query parameter to RecognizedEntities, you may specify the binary of an image in the body of a POST request.
// If you specify the image in the body of a POST request, you must specify this header and set its value to
// multipart/form-data. The maximum image size is 1 MB.
// userAgent - the user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an
// optimized experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent
// should be the same string that any commonly used browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
// 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following are examples of user-agent
// strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows Phone 8.0; Trident/6.0; IEMobile/10.0;

// clientID - bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often
// flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different
// flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the
// user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an
// inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than the
// first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
// client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help
// improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help
// with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the
// API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the client
// ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to
// receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from
// the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client
// ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
// X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the
// first time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
// makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a
// persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other
// apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses
// your app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
// header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing
// requests for the user on that device. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in
// the request.
// clientIP - the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to discover the user's
// location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are
// encouraged to always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
// example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the location not being
// anywhere near the device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
// location - a semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's geographical location.
// Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local content.
// Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
// location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater
// than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and
// positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location, in
// degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
// values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
// radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by
// the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation,
// and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
// location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's
// relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
// counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional):
// The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional):
// The altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the
// vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the
// keys are optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
// Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
// location is especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
// location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include this header and the
// X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
// cropBottom - the bottom coordinate of the region to crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the
// original image's height and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the coordinate as a
// value from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter
// when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
// cropLeft - the left coordinate of the region to crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original
// image's height and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the coordinate as a value
// from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when
// calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
// cropRight - the right coordinate of the region to crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original
// image's height and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the coordinate as a value
// from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when
// calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
// cropTop - the top coordinate of the region to crop. The coordinate is a fractional value of the original
// image's height and is measured from the top, left corner of the image. Specify the coordinate as a value
// from 0.0 through 1.0. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when
// calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
// cropType - the crop type to use when cropping the image based on the coordinates specified in the cal, cat,
// car, and cab parameters. The following are the possible values. 0: Rectangular (default). Use this parameter
// only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web
// Search APIs.
// countryCode - a 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. For a list of possible
// values, see [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
// If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
// [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
// header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and combine that language
// with the country code that you specify to determine the market to return results for. If the languages list
// does not include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request,
// or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified one. You should use
// this query parameter and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
// otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and the
// [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt) query
// parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
// ID - an ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use this parameter to ensure that the specified image is the
// first image in the list of images that Bing returns. The
// [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
// object's imageId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to.
// imageURL - the URL of an image that you want to get insights of. Use this parameter as an alternative to
// using the insightsToken parameter to specify the image. You may also specify the image by placing the binary
// of the image in the body of a POST request. If you use the binary option, see the
// [Content-Type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#contenttype)
// header. The maximum supported image size is 1 MB. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not
// specify this parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
// insightsToken - an image token. The
// [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
// object's
// [imageInsightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image-imageinsightstoken)
// contains the token. Specify this parameter to get additional information about an image, such as a caption
// or shopping source. For a list of the additional information about an image that you can get, see the
// [modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#modulesrequested)
// query parameter. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling
// the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
// modules - a comma-delimited list of insights to request. The following are the possible case-insensitive
// values. All: Return all insights, if available, except RecognizedEntities. BRQ: Best representative query.
// The query term that best describes the image. Caption: A caption that provides information about the image.
// If the caption contains entities, the response may include links to images of those entities. Collections: A
// list of related images. Recipes: A list of recipes for cooking the food shown in the images. PagesIncluding:
// A list of webpages that include the image. RecognizedEntities: A list of entities (people) that were
// recognized in the image. NOTE: You may not specify this module with any other module. If you specify it with
// other modules, the response doesn't include recognized entities. RelatedSearches: A list of related searches
// made by others. ShoppingSources: A list of merchants where you can buy related offerings. SimilarImages: A
// list of images that are visually similar to the original image. SimilarProducts: A list of images that
// contain a product that is similar to a product found in the original image. Tags: Provides characteristics
// of the type of content found in the image. For example, if the image is of a person, the tags might indicate
// the person's gender and type of clothes they're wearing. If you specify a module and there is no data for
// the module, the response object doesn't include the related field. For example, if you specify Caption and
// it does not exist, the response doesn't include the imageCaption field. To include related searches, the
// request must include the original query string. Although the original query string is not required for
// similar images or products, you should always include it because it can help improve relevance and the
// results. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the
// Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
// market - the market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the
// request from. However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a country where Bing
// delivers results. The market must be in the form <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The
// string is case insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
// NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying the market helps Bing route the
// request and return an appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in
// [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
// Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject to change. This parameter and
// the [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc) query
// parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
// safeSearch - filter images for adult content. The following are the possible filter values. Off: May return
// images with adult content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response includes thumbnail
// images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the request is through the Web Search API, the response
// includes thumbnail images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the Image Search
// API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If the request is through the Web Search API,
// the response may include images with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do
// not return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that
// Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
// Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content
// regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content
// on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content.
// setLang - the language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter
// language code. For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although
// optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified
// by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language. This parameter
// and the
// [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
// header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string is a string that's used as a
// label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any
// links to Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified language.

// clientID - bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often
// flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different
// flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the
// user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an
// inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than the
// first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
// client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help
// improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help
// with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the
// API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the client
// ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to
// receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from
// the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client
// ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
// X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the
// first time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
// makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a
// persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other
// apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses
// your app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
// header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing
// requests for the user on that device. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in
// the request.
// clientIP - the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to discover the user's
// location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are
// encouraged to always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
// example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the location not being
// anywhere near the device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
// location - a semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's geographical location.
// Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local content.
// Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
// location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater
// than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and
// positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location, in
// degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
// values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
// radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by
// the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation,
// and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
// location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's
// relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
// counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional):
// The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional):
// The altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the
// vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the
// keys are optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
// Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
// location is especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
// location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include this header and the
// X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
// aspect - filter images by the following aspect ratios. All: Do not filter by aspect.Specifying this value is
// the same as not specifying the aspect parameter. Square: Return images with standard aspect ratio. Wide:
// Return images with wide screen aspect ratio. Tall: Return images with tall aspect ratio.
// colorParameter - filter images by the following color options. ColorOnly: Return color images. Monochrome:
// Return black and white images. Return images with one of the following dominant colors: Black, Blue, Brown,
// Gray, Green, Orange, Pink, Purple, Red, Teal, White, Yellow
// countryCode - a 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. For a list of possible
// values, see [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
// If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
// [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
// header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and combine that language
// with the country code that you specify to determine the market to return results for. If the languages list
// does not include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request,
// or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified one. You should use
// this query parameter and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
// otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and the
// [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt) query
// parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
// count - the number of images to return in the response. The actual number delivered may be less than
// requested. The default is 35. The maximum value is 150. You use this parameter along with the offset
// parameter to page results.For example, if your user interface displays 20 images per page, set count to 20
// and offset to 0 to get the first page of results.For each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for
// example, 0, 20, 40). Use this parameter only with the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when
// calling the Insights, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
// freshness - filter images by the following discovery options. Day: Return images discovered by Bing within
// the last 24 hours. Week: Return images discovered by Bing within the last 7 days. Month: Return images
// discovered by Bing within the last 30 days.
// height - filter images that have the specified height, in pixels. You may use this filter with the size
// filter to return small images that have a height of 150 pixels.
// ID - an ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use this parameter to ensure that the specified image is the
// first image in the list of images that Bing returns. The
// [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
// object's imageId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to.
// imageContent - filter images by the following content types. Face: Return images that show only a person's
// face. Portrait: Return images that show only a person's head and shoulders.
// imageType - filter images by the following image types. AnimatedGif: Return only animated GIFs. Clipart:
// Return only clip art images. Line: Return only line drawings. Photo: Return only photographs(excluding line
// drawings, animated Gifs, and clip art). Shopping: Return only images that contain items where Bing knows of
// a merchant that is selling the items. This option is valid in the en - US market only.Transparent: Return
// only images with a transparent background.
// license - filter images by the following license types. All: Do not filter by license type.Specifying this
// value is the same as not specifying the license parameter. Any: Return images that are under any license
// type. The response doesn't include images that do not specify a license or the license is unknown. Public:
// Return images where the creator has waived their exclusive rights, to the fullest extent allowed by law.
// Share: Return images that may be shared with others. Changing or editing the image might not be allowed.
// Also, modifying, sharing, and using the image for commercial purposes might not be allowed. Typically, this
// option returns the most images. ShareCommercially: Return images that may be shared with others for personal
// or commercial purposes. Changing or editing the image might not be allowed. Modify: Return images that may
// be modified, shared, and used. Changing or editing the image might not be allowed. Modifying, sharing, and
// using the image for commercial purposes might not be allowed. ModifyCommercially: Return images that may be
// modified, shared, and used for personal or commercial purposes. Typically, this option returns the fewest
// images. For more information about these license types, see [Filter Images By License
// Type](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=309768).
// market - the market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the
// request from. However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a country where Bing
// delivers results. The market must be in the form <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The
// string is case insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
// NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying the market helps Bing route the
// request and return an appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in
// [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
// Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject to change. This parameter and
// the [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc) query
// parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
// maxFileSize - filter images that are less than or equal to the specified file size. The maximum file size
// that you may specify is 520,192 bytes. If you specify a larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is possible
// that the response may include images that are slightly larger than the specified maximum. You may specify
// this filter and minFileSize to filter images within a range of file sizes.
// maxHeight - filter images that have a height that is less than or equal to the specified height. Specify the
// height in pixels. You may specify this filter and minHeight to filter images within a range of heights. This
// filter and the height filter are mutually exclusive.
// maxWidth - filter images that have a width that is less than or equal to the specified width. Specify the
// width in pixels. You may specify this filter and maxWidth to filter images within a range of widths. This
// filter and the width filter are mutually exclusive.
// minFileSize - filter images that are greater than or equal to the specified file size. The maximum file size
// that you may specify is 520,192 bytes. If you specify a larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is possible
// that the response may include images that are slightly smaller than the specified minimum. You may specify
// this filter and maxFileSize to filter images within a range of file sizes.
// minHeight - filter images that have a height that is greater than or equal to the specified height. Specify
// the height in pixels. You may specify this filter and maxHeight to filter images within a range of heights.
// This filter and the height filter are mutually exclusive.
// minWidth - filter images that have a width that is greater than or equal to the specified width. Specify the
// width in pixels. You may specify this filter and maxWidth to filter images within a range of widths. This
// filter and the width filter are mutually exclusive.
// offset - the zero-based offset that indicates the number of images to skip before returning images. The
// default is 0. The offset should be less than
// ([totalEstimatedMatches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#totalestimatedmatches)
// - count). Use this parameter along with the count parameter to page results. For example, if your user
// interface displays 20 images per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For
// each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). It is possible for multiple pages to
// include some overlap in results. To prevent duplicates, see
// [nextOffset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#nextoffset).
// Use this parameter only with the Image API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Trending Images
// API or the Web Search API.
// safeSearch - filter images for adult content. The following are the possible filter values. Off: May return
// images with adult content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response includes thumbnail
// images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the request is through the Web Search API, the response
// includes thumbnail images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the Image Search
// API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If the request is through the Web Search API,
// the response may include images with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do
// not return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that
// Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
// Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content
// regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content
// on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content.
// size - filter images by the following sizes. All: Do not filter by size. Specifying this value is the same
// as not specifying the size parameter. Small: Return images that are less than 200x200 pixels. Medium: Return
// images that are greater than or equal to 200x200 pixels but less than 500x500 pixels. Large: Return images
// that are 500x500 pixels or larger. Wallpaper: Return wallpaper images. You may use this parameter along with
// the height or width parameters. For example, you may use height and size to request small images that are
// 150 pixels tall.
// setLang - the language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter
// language code. For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although
// optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified
// by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language. This parameter
// and the
// [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
// header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string is a string that's used as a
// label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any
// links to Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
// width - filter images that have the specified width, in pixels. You may use this filter with the size filter
// to return small images that have a width of 150 pixels.

// clientID - bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often
// flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different
// flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the
// user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an
// inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than the
// first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
// client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help
// improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help
// with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the
// API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the client
// ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to
// receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from
// the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client
// ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
// X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the
// first time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
// makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a
// persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other
// apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses
// your app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
// header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing
// requests for the user on that device. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in
// the request.
// clientIP - the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to discover the user's
// location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are
// encouraged to always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
// example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the location not being
// anywhere near the device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
// location - a semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's geographical location.
// Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local content.
// Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
// location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater
// than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and
// positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location, in
// degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
// values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
// radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by
// the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation,
// and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
// location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's
// relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
// counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional):
// The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional):
// The altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the
// vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the
// keys are optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
// Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
// location is especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
// location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include this header and the
// X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
// countryCode - a 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. This API supports only
// the United States, Canada, Australia, and China markets. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set
// to us, ca, au, or cn. If you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses
// the first supported language it finds from the languages list, and combine that language with the country
// code that you specify to determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include
// a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request, or it may use an
// aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter
// and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use
// the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do
// not specify both.
// market - the market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the
// request from. However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a country where Bing
// delivers results. The market must be in the form <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The
// string is case insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
// NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying the market helps Bing route the
// request and return an appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in
// [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
// Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject to change. This parameter and
// the [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc) query
// parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
// safeSearch - filter images for adult content. The following are the possible filter values. Off: May return
// images with adult content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response includes thumbnail
// images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the request is through the Web Search API, the response
// includes thumbnail images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the Image Search
// API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If the request is through the Web Search API,
// the response may include images with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do
// not return images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that
// Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses
// Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content
// regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content
// on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content.
// setLang - the language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter
// language code. For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although
// optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified
// by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language. This parameter
// and the
// [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
// header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string is a string that's used as a
// label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any
// links to Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
