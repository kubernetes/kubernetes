// VideosClient is the the Video Search API lets you search on Bing for video that are relevant to the user's search
// query, for insights about a video or for videos that are trending based on search requests made by others. This
// section provides technical details about the query parameters and headers that you use to request videos and the
// JSON response objects that contain them. For examples that show how to make requests, see [Searching the Web for
// Videos](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-video-search/search-the-web).

// Details sends the details request.
// Parameters:
// query - the user's search query string. The query string cannot be empty. The query string may contain [Bing
// Advanced Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example, to limit videos to a
// specific domain, use the [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator. Use this
// parameter only with the Video Search API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the Trending Videos
// API.
// acceptLanguage - a comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user interface strings. The list
// is in decreasing order of preference. For additional information, including expected format, see
// [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This header and the
// [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
// query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify
// the [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc) query
// parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses the first supported language it finds
// from the list and combines it with the cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported
// language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses an aggregated or
// default market for the results. To determine the market that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use
// this header and the cc query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
// [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#mkt) and
// [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#setlang)
// query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are
// few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response
// objects apply the specified language.
// userAgent - the user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to provide mobile users with an
// optimized experience. Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent
// should be the same string that any commonly used browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
// 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following are examples of user-agent

// clientID - bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often
// flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different
// flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the
// user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an
// inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than the
// first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
// client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help
// improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help
// with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the
// API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the client
// ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to
// receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from
// the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client
// ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
// X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the
// first time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
// makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a
// persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other
// apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses
// your app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
// header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing
// requests for the user on that device. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in
// the request.
// clientIP - the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to discover the user's
// location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are
// encouraged to always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
// example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the location not being
// anywhere near the device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
// location - a semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's geographical location.
// Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local content.
// Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
// location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater
// than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and
// positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location, in
// degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
// values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
// radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by
// the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation,
// and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
// location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's
// relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
// counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional):
// The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional):
// The altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the
// vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the
// keys are optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
// Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
// location is especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
// location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include this header and the
// X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
// countryCode - a 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. This API supports only
// the United States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If you set this
// parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds
// from the languages list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine the
// market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the
// closest language and market that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the
// results instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query
// parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query
// parameters. This parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
// ID - an ID that uniquely identifies a video. The
// [Video](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#video)
// object's videoId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to. You use this parameter to identify
// the video to get insights of.
// modules - a comma-delimited list of insights to request. The following are the possible case-insensitive
// values. All: Return all available insights. RelatedVideos: Return a list of videos that are similar to the
// video specified by the id query parameter. VideoResult: Return the video that you're requesting insights of
// (this is the video that you set the id query parameter to in your insights request). If you specify an
// insight and there is no data for it, the response object does not include the related field. For example, if
// you specify RelatedVideos and none exist, the response does not include the relatedVideos field. Although
// the user's query term is not required, you should always include it because it helps to improve relevance
// and the results.
// market - the market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the
// request from. However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a country where Bing
// delivers results. The market must be in the form <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The
// string is case insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
// NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying the market helps Bing route the
// request and return an appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in
// [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
// Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject to change. This parameter and
// the [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc) query
// parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
// resolution - filter videos by the following resolutions: SD480p: Return videos with a 480p or higher
// resolution. HD720p: Return videos with a 720p or higher resolution. HD1080p: Return videos with a 1080p or
// higher resolution. All: Do not filter by resolution.Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the
// resolution parameter.
// safeSearch - filter videos for adult content. The following are the possible filter values. Off: If the
// request is through the Video Search API, the response includes adult videos and the thumbnail images of the
// videos are clear (non-fuzzy). If the request is through the Web Search API, the response includes adult
// videos but the thumbnail images of the videos are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
// Video Search API, the response does not include videos with adult content. If the request is through the Web
// Search API, the response may include videos with adult content but the thumbnail images of the videos are
// pixelated (fuzzy). Strict: Does not return videos with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the
// request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores
// the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
// response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site:
// only if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult
// content.
// setLang - the language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter
// language code. For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although
// optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified
// by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language. This parameter
// and the
// [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
// header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string is a string that's used as a
// label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any
// links to Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
// textDecorations - a Boolean value that determines whether display strings contain decoration markers such as
// hit highlighting characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The default is false. To specify
// whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers, see the
// [textFormat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#textformat)
// query parameter. For information about hit highlighting, see [Hit
// Highlighting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/hit-highlighting).
// textFormat - the type of markers to use for text decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter).
// Possible values are Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting. The Unicode
// characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning
// and end of query terms for hit highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
// formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display strings. The default is Raw. For
// display strings that contain escapable HTML characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML,
// Bing escapes the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;).

// Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
// location is especially important if the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
// location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include this header and the
// X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you should include this header.
// countryCode - a 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. This API supports only
// the United States market. If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If you set this
// parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds
// from the languages list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to determine the
// market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the
// closest language and market that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the
// results instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query
// parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query
// parameters. This parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
// count - the number of videos to return in the response. The actual number delivered may be less than
// requested. The default is 35. The maximum is 105. You may use this parameter along with the offset parameter
// to page results. For example, if your user interface presents 20 videos per page, set count to 20 and offset
// to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20,
// 40). Use this parameter only with the Video Search API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the
// Trending Videos API or the Web Search API.
// freshness - filter videos by the date and time that Bing discovered the video. The following are the
// possible filter values. Day: Return videos discovered within the last 24 hours. Week: Return videos
// discovered within the last 7 days. Month: Return videos discovered within the last 30 days.
// ID - an ID that uniquely identifies a video. The
// [Video](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#video)
// object's videoId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to. You use this parameter to ensure that
// the specified video is the first video in the list of videos that Bing returns.
// length - filter videos by the following lengths: Short: Return videos that are less than 5 minutes. Medium:
// Return videos that are between 5 and 20 minutes, inclusive. Long: Return videos that are longer than 20
// minutes. All: Do not filter by length.Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the videoLength
// parameter.
// market - the market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where the user is making the
// request from. However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a country where Bing
// delivers results. The market must be in the form <language code>-<country code>. For example, en-US. The
// string is case insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
// NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying the market helps Bing route the
// request and return an appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in
// [Market
// Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
// Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject to change. This parameter and
// the [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#cc) query
// parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
// offset - the zero-based offset that indicates the number of videos to skip before returning videos. The
// default is 0. The offset should be less than
// ([totalEstimatedMatches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#videos-totalmatches)
// - count). Use this parameter along with the count parameter to page results. For example, if your user
// interface displays 20 videos per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For
// each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). It is possible for multiple pages to
// include some overlap in results. To prevent duplicates, see
// [nextOffset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#videos-nextoffset).
// Use this parameter only with the Video Search API.
// pricing - filter videos by the following pricing options: Free: Return videos that are free to view. Paid:
// Return videos that require a subscription or payment to view. All: Do not filter by pricing.Specifying this
// value is the same as not specifying the pricing parameter.
// resolution - filter videos by the following resolutions: SD480p: Return videos with a 480p or higher
// resolution. HD720p: Return videos with a 720p or higher resolution. HD1080p: Return videos with a 1080p or
// higher resolution. All: Do not filter by resolution.Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the
// resolution parameter.
// safeSearch - filter videos for adult content. The following are the possible filter values. Off: If the
// request is through the Video Search API, the response includes adult videos and the thumbnail images of the
// videos are clear (non-fuzzy). If the request is through the Web Search API, the response includes adult
// videos but the thumbnail images of the videos are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the
// Video Search API, the response does not include videos with adult content. If the request is through the Web
// Search API, the response may include videos with adult content but the thumbnail images of the videos are
// pixelated (fuzzy). Strict: Does not return videos with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the
// request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores
// the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the
// response may contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site:
// only if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult
// content.
// setLang - the language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter
// language code. For example, the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although
// optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified
// by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language. This parameter
// and the
// [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
// header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string is a string that's used as a
// label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any
// links to Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
// textDecorations - a Boolean value that determines whether display strings contain decoration markers such as
// hit highlighting characters. If true, the strings may include markers. The default is false. To specify
// whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers, see the
// [textFormat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-video-api-v7-reference#textformat)
// query parameter. For information about hit highlighting, see [Hit
// Highlighting](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/hit-highlighting).
// textFormat - the type of markers to use for text decorations (see the textDecorations query parameter).
// Possible values are Raw—Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting. The Unicode
// characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning
// and end of query terms for hit highlighting. HTML—Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special
// formatting. For example, use <b> tags to highlight query terms in display strings. The default is Raw. For
// display strings that contain escapable HTML characters such as <, >, and &, if textFormat is set to HTML,
// Bing escapes the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to &lt;).

// query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify

// parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses the first supported language it finds

// language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses an aggregated or
// default market for the results. To determine the market that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use

// should be the same string that any commonly used browser sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC

// clientID - bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often
// flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different
// flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the
// user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an
// inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than the
// first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that
// client ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help
// improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help
// with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the
// API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the client
// ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to
// receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of results from
// the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client
// ID. If you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
// X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT include this header in a request is the
// first time the user uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
// makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a
// persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other
// apps such as mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses
// your app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this
// header. If the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing
// requests for the user on that device. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in
// the request.
// clientIP - the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to discover the user's
// location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are
// encouraged to always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
// example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in the location not being
// anywhere near the device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
// location - a semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's geographical location.
// Bing uses the location information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local content.
// Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
// location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater
// than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and
// positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of the client's location, in
// degrees. The longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
// values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
// radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by
// the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell tower triangulation,
// and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
// location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's
// relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360,
// counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional):
// The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling. alt (optional):
// The altitude of the client device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the
// vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the
// keys are optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
// Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
