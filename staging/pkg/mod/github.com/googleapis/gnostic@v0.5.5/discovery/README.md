# API Discovery Format

This directory contains a Protocol Buffer-language model and related code for
supporting Google's API Discovery Format.

Gnostic applications and plugins can use Discovery.proto to generate Protocol
Buffer support code for their preferred languages.

Discovery.go is used by Gnostic to read JSON and YAML Discovery descriptions
into the Protocol Buffer-based datastructures generated from Discovery.proto.

Discovery.proto and Discovery.go are generated by the Gnostic compiler
generator, and Discovery.pb.go is generated by protoc, the Protocol Buffer
compiler, and protoc-gen-go, the Protocol Buffer Go code generation plugin.
