Prometheus uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request,
  addressing (with `@...`) the maintainer of this repository (see
  [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)) in the description of the pull request.

* If you plan to do something more involved, first discuss your ideas
  on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/prometheus-developers).
  This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal
  of inspiration.

* Relevant coding style guidelines are the [Go Code Review
  Comments](https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
  and the _Formatting and style_ section of Peter Bourgon's [Go: Best
  Practices for Production
  Environments](http://peter.bourgon.org/go-in-production/#formatting-and-style).

* Be sure to sign off on the [DCO](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works)
