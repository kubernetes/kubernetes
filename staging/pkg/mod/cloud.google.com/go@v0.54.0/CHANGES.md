### Code changes required from v0.9.0

- pubsub: Replace

    ```
    sub.ModifyPushConfig(ctx, pubsub.PushConfig{Endpoint: "https://example.com/push"})
    ```

  with

    ```
    sub.Update(ctx, pubsub.SubscriptionConfigToUpdate{
        PushConfig: &pubsub.PushConfig{Endpoint: "https://example.com/push"},
    })
    ```

- trace: traceGRPCServerInterceptor will be provided from *trace.Client.
Given an initialized `*trace.Client` named `tc`, instead of

    ```
    s := grpc.NewServer(grpc.UnaryInterceptor(trace.GRPCServerInterceptor(tc)))
    ```

  write

    ```
    s := grpc.NewServer(grpc.UnaryInterceptor(tc.GRPCServerInterceptor()))
    ```

- trace trace.GRPCClientInterceptor will also provided from *trace.Client.
Instead of

    ```
    conn, err := grpc.Dial(srv.Addr, grpc.WithUnaryInterceptor(trace.GRPCClientInterceptor()))
    ```

  write

    ```
    conn, err := grpc.Dial(srv.Addr, grpc.WithUnaryInterceptor(tc.GRPCClientInterceptor()))
    ```

- trace: We removed the deprecated `trace.EnableGRPCTracing`. Use the gRPC
interceptor as a dial option as shown below when initializing Cloud package
clients:

    ```
    c, err := pubsub.NewClient(ctx, "project-id", option.WithGRPCDialOption(grpc.WithUnaryInterceptor(tc.GRPCClientInterceptor())))
    if err != nil {
        ...
    }
    ```


## v0.9.0

- Breaking changes to some autogenerated clients.
- rpcreplay package added.

## v0.8.0

- profiler package added.
- storage:
  - Retry Objects.Insert call.
  - Add ProgressFunc to WRiter.
- pubsub: breaking changes:
  - Publish is now asynchronous ([announcement](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/google-api-go-announce/aaqRDIQ3rvU/discussion)).
  - Subscription.Pull replaced by Subscription.Receive, which takes a callback ([announcement](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/google-api-go-announce/8pt6oetAdKc/discussion)).
  - Message.Done replaced with Message.Ack and Message.Nack.

## v0.7.0

- Release of a client library for Spanner. See
the
[blog
post](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/02/introducing-Cloud-Spanner-a-global-database-service-for-mission-critical-applications.html).
Note that although the Spanner service is beta, the Go client library is alpha.

## v0.6.0

- Beta release of BigQuery, DataStore, Logging and Storage. See the
[blog post](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/12/announcing-new-google-cloud-client.html).

- bigquery:
  - struct support. Read a row directly into a struct with
`RowIterator.Next`, and upload a row directly from a struct with `Uploader.Put`.
You can also use field tags. See the [package documentation][cloud-bigquery-ref]
for details.

  - The `ValueList` type was removed. It is no longer necessary. Instead of
   ```go
   var v ValueList
   ... it.Next(&v) ..
   ```
   use

   ```go
   var v []Value
   ... it.Next(&v) ...
   ```

  - Previously, repeatedly calling `RowIterator.Next` on the same `[]Value` or
  `ValueList` would append to the slice. Now each call resets the size to zero first.

  - Schema inference will infer the SQL type BYTES for a struct field of
  type []byte. Previously it inferred STRING.

  - The types `uint`, `uint64` and `uintptr` are no longer supported in schema
  inference. BigQuery's integer type is INT64, and those types may hold values
  that are not correctly represented in a 64-bit signed integer.

## v0.5.0

- bigquery:
  - The SQL types DATE, TIME and DATETIME are now supported. They correspond to
    the `Date`, `Time` and `DateTime` types in the new `cloud.google.com/go/civil`
    package.
  - Support for query parameters.
  - Support deleting a dataset.
  - Values from INTEGER columns will now be returned as int64, not int. This
    will avoid errors arising from large values on 32-bit systems.
- datastore:
  - Nested Go structs encoded as Entity values, instead of a
flattened list of the embedded struct's fields. This means that you may now have twice-nested slices, eg.
    ```go
    type State struct {
      Cities  []struct{
        Populations []int
      }
    }
    ```
    See [the announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-api-go-announce/79jtrdeuJAg) for
more details.
  - Contexts no longer hold namespaces; instead you must set a key's namespace
    explicitly. Also, key functions have been changed and renamed.
  - The WithNamespace function has been removed. To specify a namespace in a Query, use the Query.Namespace method:
     ```go
     q := datastore.NewQuery("Kind").Namespace("ns")
     ```
  - All the fields of Key are exported. That means you can construct any Key with a struct literal:
     ```go
     k := &Key{Kind: "Kind",  ID: 37, Namespace: "ns"}
     ```
  - As a result of the above, the Key methods Kind, ID, d.Name, Parent, SetParent and Namespace have been removed.
  - `NewIncompleteKey` has been removed, replaced by `IncompleteKey`. Replace
      ```go
      NewIncompleteKey(ctx, kind, parent)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      IncompleteKey(kind, parent)
      ```
      and if you do use namespaces, make sure you set the namespace on the returned key.
  - `NewKey` has been removed, replaced by `NameKey` and `IDKey`. Replace
      ```go
      NewKey(ctx, kind, name, 0, parent)
      NewKey(ctx, kind, "", id, parent)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      NameKey(kind, name, parent)
      IDKey(kind, id, parent)
      ```
      and if you do use namespaces, make sure you set the namespace on the returned key.
  - The `Done` variable has been removed. Replace `datastore.Done` with `iterator.Done`, from the package `google.golang.org/api/iterator`.
  - The `Client.Close` method will have a return type of error. It will return the result of closing the underlying gRPC connection.
  - See [the announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-api-go-announce/hqXtM_4Ix-0) for
more details.

## v0.4.0

- bigquery:
  -`NewGCSReference` is now a function, not a method on `Client`.
  - `Table.LoaderFrom` now accepts a `ReaderSource`, enabling
     loading data into a table from a file or any `io.Reader`.
  * Client.Table and Client.OpenTable have been removed.
      Replace
      ```go
      client.OpenTable("project", "dataset", "table")
      ```
      with
      ```go
      client.DatasetInProject("project", "dataset").Table("table")
      ```

  * Client.CreateTable has been removed.
      Replace
      ```go
      client.CreateTable(ctx, "project", "dataset", "table")
      ```
      with
      ```go
      client.DatasetInProject("project", "dataset").Table("table").Create(ctx)
      ```

  * Dataset.ListTables have been replaced with Dataset.Tables.
      Replace
      ```go
      tables, err := ds.ListTables(ctx)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      it := ds.Tables(ctx)
      for {
          table, err := it.Next()
          if err == iterator.Done {
              break
          }
          if err != nil {
              // TODO: Handle error.
          }
          // TODO: use table.
      }
      ```

  * Client.Read has been replaced with Job.Read, Table.Read and Query.Read.
      Replace
      ```go
      it, err := client.Read(ctx, job)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      it, err := job.Read(ctx)
      ```
    and similarly for reading from tables or queries.

  * The iterator returned from the Read methods is now named RowIterator. Its
    behavior is closer to the other iterators in these libraries. It no longer
    supports the Schema method; see the next item.
      Replace
      ```go
      for it.Next(ctx) {
          var vals ValueList
          if err := it.Get(&vals); err != nil {
              // TODO: Handle error.
          }
          // TODO: use vals.
      }
      if err := it.Err(); err != nil {
          // TODO: Handle error.
      }
      ```
      with
      ```
      for {
          var vals ValueList
          err := it.Next(&vals)
          if err == iterator.Done {
              break
          }
          if err != nil {
              // TODO: Handle error.
          }
          // TODO: use vals.
      }
      ```
      Instead of the `RecordsPerRequest(n)` option, write
      ```go
      it.PageInfo().MaxSize = n
      ```
      Instead of the `StartIndex(i)` option, write
      ```go
      it.StartIndex = i
      ```

  * ValueLoader.Load now takes a Schema in addition to a slice of Values.
      Replace
      ```go
      func (vl *myValueLoader) Load(v []bigquery.Value)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      func (vl *myValueLoader) Load(v []bigquery.Value, s bigquery.Schema)
      ```


  * Table.Patch is replace by Table.Update.
      Replace
      ```go
      p := table.Patch()
      p.Description("new description")
      metadata, err := p.Apply(ctx)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      metadata, err := table.Update(ctx, bigquery.TableMetadataToUpdate{
          Description: "new description",
      })
      ```

  * Client.Copy is replaced by separate methods for each of its four functions.
    All options have been replaced by struct fields.

    * To load data from Google Cloud Storage into a table, use Table.LoaderFrom.

      Replace
      ```go
      client.Copy(ctx, table, gcsRef)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      table.LoaderFrom(gcsRef).Run(ctx)
      ```
      Instead of passing options to Copy, set fields on the Loader:
      ```go
      loader := table.LoaderFrom(gcsRef)
      loader.WriteDisposition = bigquery.WriteTruncate
      ```

    * To extract data from a table into Google Cloud Storage, use
      Table.ExtractorTo. Set fields on the returned Extractor instead of
      passing options.

      Replace
      ```go
      client.Copy(ctx, gcsRef, table)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      table.ExtractorTo(gcsRef).Run(ctx)
      ```

    * To copy data into a table from one or more other tables, use
      Table.CopierFrom. Set fields on the returned Copier instead of passing options.

      Replace
      ```go
      client.Copy(ctx, dstTable, srcTable)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      dst.Table.CopierFrom(srcTable).Run(ctx)
      ```

    * To start a query job, create a Query and call its Run method. Set fields
    on the query instead of passing options.

      Replace
      ```go
      client.Copy(ctx, table, query)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      query.Run(ctx)
      ```

  * Table.NewUploader has been renamed to Table.Uploader. Instead of options,
    configure an Uploader by setting its fields.
      Replace
      ```go
      u := table.NewUploader(bigquery.UploadIgnoreUnknownValues())
      ```
      with
      ```go
      u := table.NewUploader(bigquery.UploadIgnoreUnknownValues())
      u.IgnoreUnknownValues = true
      ```

- pubsub: remove `pubsub.Done`. Use `iterator.Done` instead, where `iterator` is the package
`google.golang.org/api/iterator`.

          query = objs.Next
          for _, obj := range objs.Results {
              fmt.Println(obj)
          }
      }
      ```
      with
      ```go
      iter := bucket.Objects(d.ctx, query)
      for {
          obj, err := iter.Next()
          if err == iterator.Done {
              break
          }
          if err != nil { ... }
          fmt.Println(obj)
      }
      ```
      (The `iterator` package is at `google.golang.org/api/iterator`.)

      Replace `Query.Cursor` with `ObjectIterator.PageInfo().Token`.

      ```go
      attrs, err := src.CopyTo(ctx, dst, nil)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      attrs, err := dst.CopierFrom(src).Run(ctx)
      ```

      Replace
      ```go
      attrs, err := src.CopyTo(ctx, dst, &storage.ObjectAttrs{ContextType: "text/html"})
      ```
      with
      ```go
      c := dst.CopierFrom(src)
      c.ContextType = "text/html"
      attrs, err := c.Run(ctx)
      ```

  * ObjectHandle.ComposeFrom replaced by ObjectHandle.ComposerFrom.
      Replace
      ```go
      attrs, err := dst.ComposeFrom(ctx, []*storage.ObjectHandle{src1, src2}, nil)
      ```
      with
      ```go
      attrs, err := dst.ComposerFrom(src1, src2).Run(ctx)
      ```

  * ObjectHandle.Update's ObjectAttrs argument replaced by ObjectAttrsToUpdate.
      Replace

      ```

      Replace
      ```go
      obj.WithConditions(storage.IfGenerationMatch(0))
      ```
      with
      ```go
      obj.If(storage.Conditions{DoesNotExist: true})
      ```

  * `storage.Done` replaced by `iterator.Done` (from package `google.golang.org/api/iterator`).

- Package preview/logging deleted. Use logging instead.

## v0.2.0

- Logging client replaced with preview version (see below).

- New clients for some of Google's Machine Learning APIs: Vision, Speech, and
Natural Language.

- Preview version of a new [Stackdriver Logging][cloud-logging] client in
[`cloud.google.com/go/preview/logging`](https://godoc.org/cloud.google.com/go/preview/logging).
This client uses gRPC as its transport layer, and supports log reading, sinks
and metrics. It will replace the current client at `cloud.google.com/go/logging` shortly.
