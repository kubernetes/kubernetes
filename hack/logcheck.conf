# By default, structured logging call parameters are checked, but usage of
# those calls is not required. That is changed on a per-file basis.

# Remember to clean the golangci-lint cache when changing the configuration and
# running the verify-golangci-lint.sh script multiple times, otherwise
# golangci-lint will report stale results:
#    _output/local/bin/golangci-lint cache clean

# At this point we don't enforce the usage structured logging calls except in
# those packages that were migrated. This disables the check for other files.
