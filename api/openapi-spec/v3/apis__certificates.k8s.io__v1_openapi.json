Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \"next key\".\n\nThis field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.",

You also need to register your various plugin types.\n\n// Internal package: type MyAPIObject struct {\n\truntime.TypeMeta `json:\",inline\"`\n\tMyPlugin runtime.Object `json:\"myPlugin\"`\n} type PluginA struct {\n\tAOption string `json:\"aOption\"`\n}\n\n// External package: type MyAPIObject struct {\n\truntime.TypeMeta `json:\",inline\"`\n\tMyPlugin runtime.RawExtension `json:\"myPlugin\"`\n} type PluginA struct {\n\tAOption string `json:\"aOption\"`\n}\n\n// On the wire, the JSON will look something like this: {\n\t\"kind\":\"MyAPIObject\",\n\t\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\n\t\"myPlugin\": {\n\t\t\"kind\":\"PluginA\",\n\t\t\"aOption\":\"foo\",\n\t},\n}\n\nSo what happens? Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the serialized data into your external MyAPIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be stored, but not unpacked. The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime package's DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object. (TODO: In the case where the object is of an unknown type, a runtime.Unknown object will be created and stored.)",
