The value type of each capacity is Quantity.\n\nIf an unknown prefix is used as a lookup in either device.attributes or device.capacity, an empty map will be returned.

The scheduler compares the MaximumVolumeSize against the requested size of pending volumes to filter out unsuitable nodes.

If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {\"rule\": \"self.components['Widget'].priority < 10\"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {\"rule\": \"self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)\"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {\"rule\": \"self.startsWith('kube')\"}\n\nThe `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.\n\nUnknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an \"unknown type\". An \"unknown type\" is recursively defined as:\n  - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true\n  - An array where the items schema is of an \"unknown type\"\n  - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an \"unknown type\"\n\nOnly property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:\n\t  \"true\", \"false\", \"null\", \"in\", \"as\", \"break\", \"const\", \"continue\", \"else\", \"for\", \"function\", \"if\",\n\t  \"import\", \"let\", \"loop\", \"package\", \"namespace\", \"return\".\nExamples:\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"namespace\": {\"rule\": \"self.__namespace__ > 0\"}\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"x-prop\": {\"rule\": \"self.x__dash__prop > 0\"}\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"redact__d\": {\"rule\": \"self.redact__underscores__d > 0\"}\n\nEquality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:\n  - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and\n    non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.\n  - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values\n    are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with\n    non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.\n\nIf `rule` makes use of the `oldSelf` variable it is implicitly a `transition rule`.\n\nBy default, the `oldSelf` variable is the same type as `self`. When `optionalOldSelf` is true, the `oldSelf` variable is a CEL optional\n variable whose value() is the same type as `self`.\nSee the documentation for the `optionalOldSelf` field for details.\n\nTransition rules by default are applied only on UPDATE requests and are skipped if an old value could not be found. You can opt a transition rule into unconditional evaluation by setting `optionalOldSelf` to true.",

Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\n\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\n- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n- 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.",
