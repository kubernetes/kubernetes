    # TODO (linusa) b/182405548: Create a separate sync job that syncs
    # everything from gs://gke-release-staging into the other buckets.
    #
    # NOTE: Historically, there was once a GCS mirroring job called the
    # release_copier but it was removed after the Reliability Reset (circa
    # 2019). At that time it was determined that having a separate replication
    # job was unsafe, although it did not go into details about how to make the
    # replication smarter/safer. See http://go/reliability-reset-gke-gcr.
