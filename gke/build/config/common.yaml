  # For determining the "version" ultimately used in the build, the precedence

    #
    # This makes it so that when the docker images are saved out to a tarball

    #
    # In terms of saving images, this field is actually not necessary, because

    # These images are then possibly modified with source/license
    # injection. Each image starts out as a tarball, from which we `docker load`
    # it and tag it as a particular gcr-repo + image + tag combination.

    # The "compile" step already saves image tarballs locally which are tagged
    # with "gke.gcr.io" or $KUBE_DOCKER_REGISTRY. The "package" step does the
    # following:
    # - Re-save the image tarball to another location ready for GCS upload.
    # - Re-tag the image to a new list of GCR repos to be pushed to, Typically
    #   they are pushed to gke-release-staging and gke-on-prem-staging.

    # tagged with $KUBE_DOCKER_REGISTRY.

  # images that have the prefix of: "a/x", "a/y", "b/x", and "b/y" (we need to
  # search by image prefix because the image tags are not known until at build
  # time). The image tags are also used to further filter the search to only
  # those images that correspond to the unique VERSION we want to push.
  #
  # Under the hood, the images actually generated by the build are named
  # "...-amd64", and the pushing step is twofold. First, we push
  # <REPO>/<IMAGE>-<ARCH> (where ARCH is "amd64") and all other images that
  # match that string when viewed as a regex against the local Docker daemon.
  # Second, we create a Docker manifest list by using the just-pushed "-amd64"
  # images as the set of child images. Even though we only have 1 child image
  # (we don't build for any other architecture), we still create the manifest
  # list because we don't want downstream consumers to have to refer to images
  # by the "-amd64" suffix.
