# Kubernetes Branding Guidelines

These guidelines provide you with guidance for using the Kubernetes logo.
All artwork is made available under the Linux Foundation trademark usage
[guidelines](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/trademark-usage/). This text from
those guidelines, and the correct and incorrect usage examples, are particularly
helpful:
>Certain marks of The Linux Foundation have been created to enable you to
>communicate compatibility or interoperability of software or products. In
>addition to the requirement that any use of a mark to make an assertion of
>compatibility must, of course, be accurate, the use of these marks must
>avoid confusion regarding The Linux Foundationâ€™s association with the
>product. The use of the mark cannot imply that The Linux Foundation or
>its projects are sponsoring or endorsing the product.

Additionally, permission is granted to modify the Kubernetes mark for non-commercial uses such as t-shirts and stickers.

## Links to logo images
The Kubernetes logo is available in 2 formats (PNG & SVG), 3 layouts --
horizontal (also known as landscape format), stacked (which is closer to
square), and icon (which does not include the name and is square), and 5
colors (color/black/white/all-blue/white-text) -- so over 20 versions -- in the
CNCF [artwork](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/tree/master/projects/kubernetes)
repo.
