Package secretbox encrypts and authenticates small messages.

Secretbox uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate messages with
secret-key cryptography. The length of messages is not hidden.

It is the caller's responsibility to ensure the uniqueness of noncesâ€”for
example, by using nonce 1 for the first message, nonce 2 for the second
message, etc. Nonces are long enough that randomly generated nonces have
negligible risk of collision.

Messages should be small because:

1. The whole message needs to be held in memory to be processed.

2. Using large messages pressures implementations on small machines to decrypt
and process plaintext before authenticating it. This is very dangerous, and
this API does not allow it, but a protocol that uses excessive message sizes
might present some implementations with no other choice.

3. Fixed overheads will be sufficiently amortised by messages as small as 8KB.

4. Performance may be improved by working with messages that fit into data caches.

Thus large amounts of data should be chunked so that each message is small.
(Each message still needs a unique nonce.) If in doubt, 16KB is a reasonable
chunk size.

This package is interoperable with NaCl: https://nacl.cr.yp.to/secretbox.html.
