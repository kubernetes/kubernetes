This package is forked from https://github.com/google/btree.

The upstream repository is deprecated. Kubernetes maintains this fork to continue supporting existing usage.

Only the subset of functionality required by Kubernetes is included. The implementation is based on the generic version introduced in Go 1.18.

The core B-tree algorithm is unchanged from the upstream implementation.
