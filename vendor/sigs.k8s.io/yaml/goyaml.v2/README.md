# go-yaml fork

This package is a fork of the go-yaml library and is intended solely for consumption
by kubernetes projects. In this fork, we plan to support only critical changes required for
kubernetes, such as small bug fixes and regressions. Larger, general-purpose feature requests
should be made in the upstream go-yaml library, and we will reject such changes in this fork
unless we are pulling them from upstream.

This fork is based on v2.4.0: https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/releases/tag/v2.4.0

# YAML support for the Go language

Introduction
------------

The yaml package enables Go programs to comfortably encode and decode YAML
values. It was developed within [Canonical](https://www.canonical.com) as
part of the [juju](https://juju.ubuntu.com) project, and is based on a
pure Go port of the well-known [libyaml](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML)
C library to parse and generate YAML data quickly and reliably.

Compatibility
-------------

The yaml package supports most of YAML 1.1 and 1.2, including support for
anchors, tags, map merging, etc. Multi-document unmarshalling is not yet
implemented, and base-60 floats from YAML 1.1 are purposefully not
supported since they're a poor design and are gone in YAML 1.2.

Installation and usage
----------------------

The import path for the package is *gopkg.in/yaml.v2*.

To install it, run:

    go get gopkg.in/yaml.v2

API documentation
-----------------

If opened in a browser, the import path itself leads to the API documentation:

  * [https://gopkg.in/yaml.v2](https://gopkg.in/yaml.v2)

API stability
-------------

The package API for yaml v2 will remain stable as described in [gopkg.in](https://gopkg.in).

Example
-------

```Go
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "log"

        "gopkg.in/yaml.v2"
)

var data = `
a: Easy!
b:
  c: 2
  d: [3, 4]
`

// Note: struct fields must be public in order for unmarshal to
// correctly populate the data.
type T struct {
        A string
        B struct {
                RenamedC int   `yaml:"c"`
                D        []int `yaml:",flow"`
        }
}

func main() {
        t := T{}
    
        err := yaml.Unmarshal([]byte(data), &t)
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatalf("error: %v", err)
        }
        fmt.Printf("--- t:\n%v\n\n", t)
    
        d, err := yaml.Marshal(&t)
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatalf("error: %v", err)
        }
        fmt.Printf("--- t dump:\n%s\n\n", string(d))
    
        m := make(map[interface{}]interface{})
    
        err = yaml.Unmarshal([]byte(data), &m)
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatalf("error: %v", err)
        }
        fmt.Printf("--- m:\n%v\n\n", m)
    
        d, err = yaml.Marshal(&m)
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatalf("error: %v", err)
        }
        fmt.Printf("--- m dump:\n%s\n\n", string(d))
}
```

This example will generate the following output:

```
--- t:
{Easy! {2 [3 4]}}

--- t dump:
a: Easy!
b:
  c: 2
  d: [3, 4]


--- m:
map[a:Easy! b:map[c:2 d:[3 4]]]

--- m dump:
a: Easy!
b:
  c: 2
  d:
  - 3
  - 4
```
