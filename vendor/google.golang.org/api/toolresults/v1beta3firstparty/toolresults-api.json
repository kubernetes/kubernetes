Example:\n\npackage google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; }\n\n{ \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\", \"firstName\": , \"lastName\":  }\n\nIf the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):\n\n{ \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\", \"value\": \"1.212s\" }",

The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted). * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][] value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types.

   "description": "A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like \"day\" or \"month\". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.\n\n# Examples\n\nExample 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.\n\nTimestamp start = ...; Timestamp end = ...; Duration duration = ...;\n\nduration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds; duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;\n\nif (duration.seconds  0) { duration.seconds += 1; duration.nanos -= 1000000000; } else if (durations.seconds \u003e 0 && duration.nanos \u003c 0) { duration.seconds -= 1; duration.nanos += 1000000000; }\n\nExample 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.\n\nTimestamp start = ...; Duration duration = ...; Timestamp end = ...;\n\nend.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds; end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;\n\nif (end.nanos = 1000000000) { end.seconds += 1; end.nanos -= 1000000000; }\n\nExample 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.\n\ntd = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10) duration = Duration() duration.FromTimedelta(td)\n\n# JSON Mapping\n\nIn JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an object, where the string ends in the suffix \"s\" (indicating seconds) and is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be encoded in JSON format as \"3s\", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should be expressed in JSON format as \"3.000000001s\", and 3 seconds and 1 microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as \"3.000001s\".",

   "description": "The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:\n\n- Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs\n\n# Overview\n\nThe `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code][], but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.\n\n# Language mapping\n\nThe `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.\n\n# Other uses\n\nThe error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments.\n\nExample uses of this error model include:\n\n- Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial errors.\n\n- Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a `Status` message for error reporting.\n\n- Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each error sub-response.\n\n- Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented directly using the `Status` message.\n\n- Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.",

   "description": "A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or calendar, represented as seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution in UTC Epoch time. It is encoded using the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. It is encoded assuming all minutes are 60 seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are \"smeared\" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation. Range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from RFC 3339 date strings. See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt).\n\n# Examples\n\nExample 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `time()`.\n\nTimestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL)); timestamp.set_nanos(0);\n\nExample 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `gettimeofday()`.\n\nstruct timeval tv; gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);\n\nTimestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec); timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);\n\nExample 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.\n\nFILETIME ft; GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft); UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) \u003c\u003c 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;\n\n// A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL)); timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));\n\nExample 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.\n\nlong millis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n\nTimestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000) .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();\n\n\n\nExample 5: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.\n\ntimestamp = Timestamp() timestamp.GetCurrentTime()\n\n# JSON Mapping\n\nIn JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is \"{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z\" where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day}, {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The \"Z\" suffix indicates the timezone (\"UTC\"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as indicated by \"Z\") is presently supported.\n\nFor example, \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.\n\nIn JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString] method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted to this format using [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`]( http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.",
