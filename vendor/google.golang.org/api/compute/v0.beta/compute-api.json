The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, \u003e, or \u003c.\n\nFor example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.\n\nYou can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.\n\nTo filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Skylake\") OR (cpuPlatform = \"Intel Broadwell\") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).",

The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests. \n- RANDOM: The load balancer selects a random healthy host. \n- ORIGINAL_DESTINATION: Backend host is selected based on the client connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address as the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection was redirected to the load balancer. \n- MAGLEV: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and host selection times.

Valid values are:  \n- 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused streams. \n- gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504.\n- \n- connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts. \n- retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes. Currently the only retriable error supported is 409. \n- refused-stream:Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code.
