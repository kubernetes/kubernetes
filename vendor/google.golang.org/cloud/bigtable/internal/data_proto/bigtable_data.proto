// Takes a row as input and produces an alternate view of the row based on

// return all the cells of a row but not their values. More complicated filters
// can be composed out of these components to express requests such as, "within
// every column of a particular family, give just the two most recent cells
// which are older than timestamp X."
//
// There are two broad categories of RowFilters (true filters and transformers),
// as well as two ways to compose simple filters into more complex ones
// (chains and interleaves). They work as follows:
//
// * True filters alter the input row by excluding some of its cells wholesale
// from the output row. An example of a true filter is the "value_regex_filter",
// which excludes cells whose values don't match the specified pattern. All
// regex true filters use RE2 syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)
// in raw byte mode (RE2::Latin1), and are evaluated as full matches. An
// important point to keep in mind is that RE2(.) is equivalent by default to
// RE2([^\n]), meaning that it does not match newlines. When attempting to match
// an arbitrary byte, you should therefore use the escape sequence '\C', which
// may need to be further escaped as '\\C' in your client language.
//
// * Transformers alter the input row by changing the values of some of its
// cells in the output, without excluding them completely. Currently, the only
// supported transformer is the "strip_value_transformer", which replaces every
// cell's value with the empty string.
//
// * Chains and interleaves are described in more detail in the
// RowFilter.Chain and RowFilter.Interleave documentation.
//
// The total serialized size of a RowFilter message must not
// exceed 4096 bytes, and RowFilters may not be nested within each other
// (in Chains or Interleaves) to a depth of more than 20.
message RowFilter {
  // A RowFilter which sends rows through several RowFilters in sequence.
  message Chain {
    // The elements of "filters" are chained together to process the input row:
    // in row -> f(0) -> intermediate row -> f(1) -> ... -> f(N) -> out row
    // The full chain is executed atomically.

    // they will all appear in the output row in an unspecified mutual order.
