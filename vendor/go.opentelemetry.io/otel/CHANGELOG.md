- Add `EventName` and `SetEventName` to `Record` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log`. (#6187)
- Add `EventName` to `RecordFactory` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log/logtest`. (#6187)
- `AssertRecordEqual` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log/logtest` checks `Record.EventName`. (#6187)
- Add `EventName` and `SetEventName` to `Record` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log`. (#6193)
- Add `EventName` to `RecordFactory` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log/logtest`. (#6193)

- Emit `Record.EventName` field in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlplog/otlploghttp`. (#6211)
- Emit `Record.EventName` field in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout/stdoutlog` (#6210)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.28.0` package.
  The package contains semantic conventions from the `v1.28.0` version of the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions.
  See the [migration documentation](./semconv/v1.28.0/MIGRATION.md) for information on how to upgrade from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.27.0`(#6236)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.30.0` package.
  The package contains semantic conventions from the `v1.30.0` version of the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions.
  See the [migration documentation](./semconv/v1.30.0/MIGRATION.md) for information on how to upgrade from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.28.0`(#6240)
- Document the pitfalls of using `Resource` as a comparable type.
  `Resource.Equal` and `Resource.Equivalent` should be used instead. (#6272)
- Support [Go 1.24]. (#6304)
- Add `FilterProcessor` and `EnabledParameters` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log`.
  It replaces `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log/internal/x.FilterProcessor`.
  Compared to previous version it additionally gives the possibility to filter by resource and instrumentation scope. (#6317)

### Changed

- Update `github.com/prometheus/common` to `v0.62.0`, which changes the `NameValidationScheme` to `NoEscaping`.
  This allows metrics names to keep original delimiters (e.g. `.`), rather than replacing with underscores.
  This is controlled by the `Content-Type` header, or can be reverted by setting `NameValidationScheme` to `LegacyValidation` in `github.com/prometheus/common/model`. (#6198)

### Fixes

- Eliminate goroutine leak for the processor returned by `NewSimpleSpanProcessor` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` when `Shutdown` is called and the passed `ctx` is canceled and `SpanExporter.Shutdown` has not returned. (#6368)
- Eliminate goroutine leak for the processor returned by `NewBatchSpanProcessor` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` when `ForceFlush` is called and the passed `ctx` is canceled and `SpanExporter.Export` has not returned. (#6369)

## [1.34.0/0.56.0/0.10.0] 2025-01-17

### Changed

- Remove the notices from `Logger` to make the whole Logs API user-facing in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log`. (#6167)

### Fixed

- Relax minimum Go version to 1.22.0 in various modules. (#6073)
- The `Type` name logged for the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc` client is corrected from `otlphttpgrpc` to `otlptracegrpc`. (#6143)
- The `Type` name logged for the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlphttpgrpc` client is corrected from `otlphttphttp` to `otlptracehttp`. (#6143)

- Add `EnabledInstrument` interface in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric/internal/x`.
  This is an experimental interface that is implemented by synchronous instruments provided by `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric`.
  Users can use it to avoid performing computationally expensive operations when recording measurements.
  It does not fall within the scope of the OpenTelemetry Go versioning and stability [policy](./VERSIONING.md) and it may be changed in backwards incompatible ways or removed in feature releases. (#6016)

(#5151)
  Because of that `WithDialOption` ignores [`grpc.WithBlock`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc#WithBlock), [`grpc.WithTimeout`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc#WithTimeout), and [`grpc.WithReturnConnectionError`](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc#WithReturnConnectionError).

## [1.20.0/0.43.0] 2023-11-10

This release brings a breaking change for custom trace API implementations. Some interfaces (`TracerProvider`, `Tracer`, `Span`) now embed the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/embedded` types. Implementers need to update their implementations based on what they want the default behavior to be. See the "API Implementations" section of the [trace API] package documentation for more information about how to accomplish this.

- The `TracerProvider` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` now embeds the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/embedded.TracerProvider` type.
  This extends the `TracerProvider` interface and is is a breaking change for any existing implementation.
  Implementers need to update their implementations based on what they want the default behavior of the interface to be.

- Errors from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace` exporters are wrapped in errors identifying their signal name.
  Existing users of the exporters attempting to identify specific errors will need to use `errors.Unwrap()` to get the underlying error. (#3516)
- Exporters from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp` will print the final retryable error message when attempts to retry time out. (#3514)

    This new parameter is used by `Callback` implementations to observe values for asynchronous instruments instead of calling the `Observe` method of the instrument directly. (#3584)
  - The slice of `instrument.Asynchronous` is now passed as a variadic argument. (#3587)
- The exporter from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/zipkin` is updated to use the `v1.16.0` version of semantic conventions.
  This means it no longer uses the removed `net.peer.ip` or `http.host` attributes to determine the remote endpoint.
  Instead it uses the `net.sock.peer` attributes. (#3581)
- The `Min` and `Max` fields of the `HistogramDataPoint` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric/metricdata` are now defined with the added `Extrema` type instead of a `*float64`. (#3487)

### Fixed

- Asynchronous instruments that use sum aggregators and attribute filters correctly add values from equivalent attribute sets that have been filtered. (#3439, #3549)
- The `RegisterCallback` method of the `Meter` from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric` only registers a callback for instruments created by that meter.
  Trying to register a callback with instruments from a different meter will result in an error being returned. (#3584)

### Deprecated

- The `WithTemporalitySelector` and `WithAggregationSelector` `ReaderOption`s have been changed to `ManualReaderOption`s in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric` package. (#3260)
- The periodic reader in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric` package now uses the temporality and aggregation selectors from its configured exporter instead of accepting them as options. (#3260)

### Fixed

- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus` exporter fixes duplicated `_total` suffixes. (#3369)
- Remove comparable requirement for `Reader`s. (#3387)
- Cumulative metrics from the OpenCensus bridge (`go.opentelemetry.io/otel/bridge/opencensus`) are defined as monotonic sums, instead of non-monotonic. (#3389)
- Asynchronous counters (`Counter` and `UpDownCounter`) from the metric SDK now produce delta sums when configured with delta temporality. (#3398)
- Exported `Status` codes in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/zipkin` exporter are now exported as all upper case values. (#3340)

  Use `Instrument`, `InstrumentKind`, `View`, and `NewView` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric` instead. (#3476)

## [1.11.1/0.33.0] 2022-10-19

### Added

- The Prometheus exporter in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus` registers with a Prometheus registerer on creation.
   By default, it will register with the default Prometheus registerer.
   A non-default registerer can be used by passing the `WithRegisterer` option. (#3239)
- Added the `WithAggregationSelector` option to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus` package to change the default `AggregationSelector` used. (#3341)
- The Prometheus exporter in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus` converts the `Resource` associated with metric exports into a `target_info` metric. (#3285)

### Changed

- The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus".New` function is updated to return an error.
   It will return an error if the exporter fails to register with Prometheus. (#3239)

### Fixed

- The URL-encoded values from the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable are decoded. (#2963)
- The `baggage.NewMember` function decodes the `value` parameter instead of directly using it.

- The `Shutdown` and `ForceFlush` methods of the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace".TraceProvider` no longer return an error when no processor is registered. (#3268)
- The Prometheus exporter in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus` cumulatively sums histogram buckets. (#3281)
- The sum of each histogram data point is now uniquely exported by the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlpmetric` exporters. (#3284, #3293)
- Recorded values for asynchronous counters (`Counter` and `UpDownCounter`) are interpreted as exact, not incremental, sum values by the metric SDK. (#3350, #3278)
- `UpDownCounters` are now correctly output as Prometheus gauges in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus` exporter. (#3358)
- The Prometheus exporter in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus` no longer describes the metrics it will send to Prometheus on startup.
   Instead the exporter is defined as an "unchecked" collector for Prometheus.
   This fixes the `reader is not registered` warning currently emitted on startup. (#3291 #3342)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus` exporter now correctly adds `_total` suffixes to counter metrics. (#3360)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus` exporter now adds a unit suffix to metric names.
   This can be disabled using the `WithoutUnits()` option added to that package. (#3352)

- Return the existing instrument when a view transforms a creation call to match an existing instrument. (#3240, #3251)
- Log a warning when a conflicting instrument (e.g. description, unit, data-type) is created instead of returning an error. (#3251)
- The OpenCensus bridge no longer sends empty batches of metrics. (#3263)

### Fixed

- Globally delegated instruments are unwrapped before delegating asynchronous callbacks. (#2784)
- Remove import of `testing` package in non-tests builds of the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` package. (#2786)

### Changed

## [1.6.3] - 2022-04-07

### Fixed

- Allow non-comparable global `MeterProvider`, `TracerProvider`, and `TextMapPropagator` types to be set. (#2772, #2773)

## [1.6.2] - 2022-04-06

### Changed

- Don't panic anymore when setting a global TracerProvider or TextMapPropagator to itself. (#2749)
- Upgrade `go.opentelemetry.io/proto/otlp` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace` from `v0.12.1` to `v0.15.0`.
  This replaces the use of the now deprecated `InstrumentationLibrary` and `InstrumentationLibrarySpans` types and fields in the proto library with the equivalent `InstrumentationScope` and `ScopeSpans`. (#2748)

## [1.6.1] - 2022-03-28

### Fixed

- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/schema/*` packages now use the correct schema URL for their `SchemaURL` constant.
  Instead of using `"https://opentelemetry.io/schemas/v<version>"` they now use the correct URL without a `v` prefix, `"https://opentelemetry.io/schemas/<version>"`. (#2743, #2744)

### Security

- Upgrade `go.opentelemetry.io/proto/otlp` from `v0.12.0` to `v0.12.1`.
  This includes an indirect upgrade of `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway` which resolves [a vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11254) from `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` in version `v2.2.3`. (#2724, #2728)

## [1.6.0/0.28.0] - 2022-03-23

### ⚠️ Notice ⚠️

This update is a breaking change of the unstable Metrics API.
Code instrumented with the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric` will need to be modified.

### Added

- Add metrics exponential histogram support.
  New mapping functions have been made available in `sdk/metric/aggregator/exponential/mapping` for other OpenTelemetry projects to take dependencies on. (#2502)
- Add Go 1.18 to our compatibility tests. (#2679)
- Allow configuring the Sampler with the `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` and `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` environment variables. (#2305, #2517)
- Add the `metric/global` for obtaining and setting the global `MeterProvider`. (#2660)

### Changed

- The metrics API has been significantly changed to match the revised OpenTelemetry specification.
  High-level changes include:

  - Synchronous and asynchronous instruments are now handled by independent `InstrumentProvider`s.
    These `InstrumentProvider`s are managed with a `Meter`.
  - Synchronous and asynchronous instruments are grouped into their own packages based on value types.
  - Asynchronous callbacks can now be registered with a `Meter`.

  Be sure to check out the metric module documentation for more information on how to use the revised API. (#2587, #2660)

### Fixed

- Fallback to general attribute limits when span specific ones are not set in the environment. (#2675, #2677)

## [1.5.0] - 2022-03-16

### Added

- Log the Exporters configuration in the TracerProviders message. (#2578)
- Added support to configure the span limits with environment variables.
  The following environment variables are supported. (#2606, #2637)
  - `OTEL_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_LENGTH_LIMIT`
  - `OTEL_SPAN_ATTRIBUTE_COUNT_LIMIT`
  - `OTEL_SPAN_EVENT_COUNT_LIMIT`
  - `OTEL_EVENT_ATTRIBUTE_COUNT_LIMIT`
  - `OTEL_SPAN_LINK_COUNT_LIMIT`
  - `OTEL_LINK_ATTRIBUTE_COUNT_LIMIT`

  If the provided environment variables are invalid (negative), the default values would be used.
- Rename the `gc` runtime name to `go` (#2560)
- Add resource container ID detection. (#2418)
- Add span attribute value length limit.
  The new `AttributeValueLengthLimit` field is added to the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace".SpanLimits` type to configure this limit for a `TracerProvider`.
  The default limit for this resource is "unlimited". (#2637)
- Add the `WithRawSpanLimits` option to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace`.
  This option replaces the `WithSpanLimits` option.
  Zero or negative values will not be changed to the default value like `WithSpanLimits` does.
  Setting a limit to zero will effectively disable the related resource it limits and setting to a negative value will mean that resource is unlimited.
  Consequentially, limits should be constructed using `NewSpanLimits` and updated accordingly. (#2637)

### Changed

- Drop oldest tracestate `Member` when capacity is reached. (#2592)
- Add event and link drop counts to the exported data from the `oltptrace` exporter. (#2601)
- Unify path cleaning functionally in the `otlpmetric` and `otlptrace` configuration. (#2639)
- Change the debug message from the `sdk/trace.BatchSpanProcessor` to reflect the count is cumulative. (#2640)
- Introduce new internal `envconfig` package for OTLP exporters. (#2608)
- If `http.Request.Host` is empty, fall back to use `URL.Host` when populating `http.host` in the `semconv` packages. (#2661)

### Fixed

- Remove the OTLP trace exporter limit of SpanEvents when exporting. (#2616)
- Default to port `4318` instead of `4317` for the `otlpmetrichttp` and `otlptracehttp` client. (#2614, #2625)
- Unlimited span limits are now supported (negative values). (#2636, #2637)

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace".WithSpanLimits`.
  Use `WithRawSpanLimits` instead.
  That option allows setting unlimited and zero limits, this option does not.
  This option will be kept until the next major version incremented release. (#2637)

## [1.4.1] - 2022-02-16

### Fixed

- Fix race condition in reading the dropped spans number for the `BatchSpanProcessor`. (#2615)

## [1.4.0] - 2022-02-11

### Added

- Use `OTEL_EXPORTER_ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT` environment variable to specify zipkin collector endpoint. (#2490)
- Log the configuration of `TracerProvider`s, and `Tracer`s for debugging.
  To enable use a logger with Verbosity (V level) `>=1`. (#2500)
- Added support to configure the batch span-processor with environment variables.
  The following environment variables are used. (#2515)
  - `OTEL_BSP_SCHEDULE_DELAY`
  - `OTEL_BSP_EXPORT_TIMEOUT`
  - `OTEL_BSP_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE`.
  - `OTEL_BSP_MAX_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE`

### Changed

- Zipkin exporter exports `Resource` attributes in the `Tags` field. (#2589)

### Deprecated

- Deprecate module the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/export/metric`.
  Use the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric` module instead. (#2382)
- Deprecate `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric".AtomicFieldOffsets`. (#2445)

### Fixed

- Fixed the instrument kind for noop async instruments to correctly report an implementation. (#2461)
- Fix UDP packets overflowing with Jaeger payloads. (#2489, #2512)
- Change the `otlpmetric.Client` interface's `UploadMetrics` method to accept a single `ResourceMetrics` instead of a slice of them. (#2491)
- Specify explicit buckets in Prometheus example, fixing issue where example only has `+inf` bucket. (#2419, #2493)
- W3C baggage will now decode urlescaped values. (#2529)
- Baggage members are now only validated once, when calling `NewMember` and not also when adding it to the baggage itself. (#2522)
- The order attributes are dropped from spans in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` package when capacity is reached is fixed to be in compliance with the OpenTelemetry specification.
  Instead of dropping the least-recently-used attribute, the last added attribute is dropped.
  This drop order still only applies to attributes with unique keys not already contained in the span.
  If an attribute is added with a key already contained in the span, that attribute is updated to the new value being added. (#2576)

### Removed

- Updated `go.opentelemetry.io/proto/otlp` from `v0.11.0` to `v0.12.0`. This version removes a number of deprecated methods. (#2546)
  - [`Metric.GetIntGauge()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/proto/otlp@v0.11.0/metrics/v1#Metric.GetIntGauge)
  - [`Metric.GetIntHistogram()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/proto/otlp@v0.11.0/metrics/v1#Metric.GetIntHistogram)
  - [`Metric.GetIntSum()`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/proto/otlp@v0.11.0/metrics/v1#Metric.GetIntSum)

## [1.3.0] - 2021-12-10

### ⚠️ Notice ⚠️

We have updated the project minimum supported Go version to 1.16

### Added

- Added an internal Logger.
  This can be used by the SDK and API to provide users with feedback of the internal state.
  To enable verbose logs configure the logger which will print V(1) logs. For debugging information configure to print V(5) logs. (#2343)
- Add the `WithRetry` `Option` and the `RetryConfig` type to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporter/otel/otlpmetric/otlpmetrichttp` package to specify retry behavior consistently. (#2425)
- Add `SpanStatusFromHTTPStatusCodeAndSpanKind` to all `semconv` packages to return a span status code similar to `SpanStatusFromHTTPStatusCode`, but exclude `4XX` HTTP errors as span errors if the span is of server kind. (#2296)

### Changed

- The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporter/otel/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc".Client` now uses the underlying gRPC `ClientConn` to handle name resolution, TCP connection establishment (with retries and backoff) and TLS handshakes, and handling errors on established connections by re-resolving the name and reconnecting. (#2329)
- The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporter/otel/otlpmetric/otlpmetricgrpc".Client` now uses the underlying gRPC `ClientConn` to handle name resolution, TCP connection establishment (with retries and backoff) and TLS handshakes, and handling errors on established connections by re-resolving the name and reconnecting. (#2425)
- The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporter/otel/otlpmetric/otlpmetricgrpc".RetrySettings` type is renamed to `RetryConfig`. (#2425)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporter/otel/*` gRPC exporters now default to using the host's root CA set if none are provided by the user and `WithInsecure` is not specified. (#2432)
- Change `resource.Default` to be evaluated the first time it is called, rather than on import. This allows the caller the option to update `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` first, such as with `os.Setenv`. (#2371)

### Fixed

- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporter/otel/*` exporters are updated to handle per-signal and universal endpoints according to the OpenTelemetry specification.
  Any per-signal endpoint set via an `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_<signal>_ENDPOINT` environment variable is now used without modification of the path.
  When `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set, if it contains a path, that path is used as a base path which per-signal paths are appended to. (#2433)
- Basic metric controller updated to use sync.Map to avoid blocking calls (#2381)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporter/jaeger` correctly sets the `otel.status_code` value to be a string of `ERROR` or `OK` instead of an integer code. (#2439, #2440)

### Deprecated

- Deprecated the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporter/otel/otlpmetric/otlpmetrichttp".WithMaxAttempts` `Option`, use the new `WithRetry` `Option` instead. (#2425)
- Deprecated the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporter/otel/otlpmetric/otlpmetrichttp".WithBackoff` `Option`, use the new `WithRetry` `Option` instead. (#2425)

### Removed

- Remove the metric Processor's ability to convert cumulative to delta aggregation temporality. (#2350)
- Remove the metric Bound Instruments interface and implementations. (#2399)
- Remove the metric MinMaxSumCount kind aggregation and the corresponding OTLP export path. (#2423)
- Metric SDK removes the "exact" aggregator for histogram instruments, as it performed a non-standard aggregation for OTLP export (creating repeated Gauge points) and worked its way into a number of confusing examples. (#2348)

## [1.2.0] - 2021-11-12

### Changed

- Metric SDK `export.ExportKind`, `export.ExportKindSelector` types have been renamed to `aggregation.Temporality` and `aggregation.TemporalitySelector` respectively to keep in line with current specification and protocol along with built-in selectors (e.g., `aggregation.CumulativeTemporalitySelector`, ...). (#2274)
- The Metric `Exporter` interface now requires a `TemporalitySelector` method instead of an `ExportKindSelector`. (#2274)
- Metrics API cleanup. The `metric/sdkapi` package has been created to relocate the API-to-SDK interface:
  - The following interface types simply moved from `metric` to `metric/sdkapi`: `Descriptor`, `MeterImpl`, `InstrumentImpl`, `SyncImpl`, `BoundSyncImpl`, `AsyncImpl`, `AsyncRunner`, `AsyncSingleRunner`, and `AsyncBatchRunner`
  - The following struct types moved and are replaced with type aliases, since they are exposed to the user: `Observation`, `Measurement`.
  - The No-op implementations of sync and async instruments are no longer exported, new functions `sdkapi.NewNoopAsyncInstrument()` and `sdkapi.NewNoopSyncInstrument()` are provided instead. (#2271)
- Update the SDK `BatchSpanProcessor` to export all queued spans when `ForceFlush` is called. (#2080, #2335)

### Added

- Add the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlpmetric/otlpmetricgrpc".WithGRPCConn` option so the exporter can reuse an existing gRPC connection. (#2002)
- Added a new `schema` module to help parse Schema Files in OTEP 0152 format. (#2267)
- Added a new `MapCarrier` to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/propagation` package to hold propagated cross-cutting concerns as a `map[string]string` held in memory. (#2334)

## [1.1.0] - 2021-10-27

### Added

- Add the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc".WithGRPCConn` option so the exporter can reuse an existing gRPC connection. (#2002)
- Add the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.7.0` package.
  The package contains semantic conventions from the `v1.7.0` version of the OpenTelemetry specification. (#2320)
- Add the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.6.1` package.
  The package contains semantic conventions from the `v1.6.1` version of the OpenTelemetry specification. (#2321)
- Add the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.5.0` package.
  The package contains semantic conventions from the `v1.5.0` version of the OpenTelemetry specification. (#2322)
  - When upgrading from the `semconv/v1.4.0` package note the following name changes:
    - `K8SReplicasetUIDKey` -> `K8SReplicaSetUIDKey`
    - `K8SReplicasetNameKey` -> `K8SReplicaSetNameKey`
    - `K8SStatefulsetUIDKey` -> `K8SStatefulSetUIDKey`
    - `k8SStatefulsetNameKey` -> `K8SStatefulSetNameKey`
    - `K8SDaemonsetUIDKey` -> `K8SDaemonSetUIDKey`
    - `K8SDaemonsetNameKey` -> `K8SDaemonSetNameKey`

### Changed

- Links added to a span will be dropped by the SDK if they contain an invalid span context (#2275).

### Fixed

- The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.4.0".HTTPServerAttributesFromHTTPRequest` now correctly only sets the HTTP client IP attribute even if the connection was routed with proxies and there are multiple addresses in the `X-Forwarded-For` header. (#2282, #2284)
- The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.4.0".NetAttributesFromHTTPRequest` function correctly handles IPv6 addresses as IP addresses and sets the correct net peer IP instead of the net peer hostname attribute. (#2283, #2285)
- The simple span processor shutdown method deterministically returns the exporter error status if it simultaneously finishes when the deadline is reached. (#2290, #2289)

## [1.0.1] - 2021-10-01

### Fixed

- json stdout exporter no longer crashes due to concurrency bug. (#2265)

## [Metrics 0.24.0] - 2021-10-01

### Changed

- NoopMeterProvider is now private and NewNoopMeterProvider must be used to obtain a noopMeterProvider. (#2237)
- The Metric SDK `Export()` function takes a new two-level reader interface for iterating over results one instrumentation library at a time. (#2197)
  - The former `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/export/metric".CheckpointSet` is renamed `Reader`.
  - The new interface is named `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/export/metric".InstrumentationLibraryReader`.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-09-20

This is the first stable release for the project.
This release includes an API and SDK for the tracing signal that will comply with the stability guarantees defined by the projects [versioning policy](./VERSIONING.md).

### Added

- OTLP trace exporter now sets the `SchemaURL` field in the exported telemetry if the Tracer has `WithSchemaURL` option. (#2242)

### Fixed

- Slice-valued attributes can correctly be used as map keys. (#2223)

### Removed

- Removed the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/zipkin".WithSDKOptions` function. (#2248)
- Removed the deprecated package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/oteltest`. (#2234)
- Removed the deprecated package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/bridge/opencensus/utils`. (#2233)
- Removed deprecated functions, types, and methods from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute` package.
  Use the typed functions and methods added to the package instead. (#2235)
  - The `Key.Array` method is removed.
  - The `Array` function is removed.
  - The `Any` function is removed.
  - The `ArrayValue` function is removed.
  - The `AsArray` function is removed.

## [1.0.0-RC3] - 2021-09-02

### Added

- Added `ErrorHandlerFunc` to use a function as an `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel".ErrorHandler`. (#2149)
- Added `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace".WithStackTrace` option to add a stack trace when using `span.RecordError` or when panic is handled in `span.End`. (#2163)
- Added typed slice attribute types and functionality to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute` package to replace the existing array type and functions. (#2162)
  - `BoolSlice`, `IntSlice`, `Int64Slice`, `Float64Slice`, and `StringSlice` replace the use of the `Array` function in the package.
- Added the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/example/fib` example package.
  Included is an example application that computes Fibonacci numbers. (#2203)

### Changed

- Metric instruments have been renamed to match the (feature-frozen) metric API specification:
  - ValueRecorder becomes Histogram
  - ValueObserver becomes Gauge
  - SumObserver becomes CounterObserver
  - UpDownSumObserver becomes UpDownCounterObserver
  The API exported from this project is still considered experimental. (#2202)
- Metric SDK/API implementation type `InstrumentKind` moves into `sdkapi` sub-package. (#2091)
- The Metrics SDK export record no longer contains a Resource pointer, the SDK `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace/export/metric".Exporter.Export()` function for push-based exporters now takes a single Resource argument, pull-based exporters use `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric/controller/basic".Controller.Resource()`. (#2120)
- The JSON output of the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout/stdouttrace` is harmonized now such that the output is "plain" JSON objects after each other of the form `{ ... } { ... } { ... }`. Earlier the JSON objects describing a span were wrapped in a slice for each `Exporter.ExportSpans` call, like `[ { ... } ][ { ... } { ... } ]`. Outputting JSON object directly after each other is consistent with JSON loggers, and a bit easier to parse and read. (#2196)
- Update the `NewTracerConfig`, `NewSpanStartConfig`, `NewSpanEndConfig`, and `NewEventConfig` function in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` package to return their respective configurations as structs instead of pointers to the struct. (#2212)

### Deprecated

- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/bridge/opencensus/utils` package is deprecated.
  All functionality from this package now exists in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/bridge/opencensus` package.
  The functions from that package should be used instead. (#2166)
- The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute".Array` function and the related `ARRAY` value type is deprecated.
  Use the typed `*Slice` functions and types added to the package instead. (#2162)
- The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute".Any` function is deprecated.
  Use the typed functions instead. (#2181)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/oteltest` package is deprecated.
  The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace/tracetest".SpanRecorder` can be registered with the default SDK (`go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace`) as a `SpanProcessor` and used as a replacement for this deprecated package. (#2188)

### Removed

- Removed metrics test package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/export/metric/metrictest`. (#2105)

### Fixed

- The `fromEnv` detector no longer throws an error when `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable is not set or empty. (#2138)
- Setting the global `ErrorHandler` with `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel".SetErrorHandler` multiple times is now supported. (#2160, #2140)
- The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute".Any` function now supports `int32` values. (#2169)
- Multiple calls to `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric/controller/basic".WithResource()` are handled correctly, and when no resources are provided `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource".Default()` is used. (#2120)
- The `WithoutTimestamps` option for the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout/stdouttrace` exporter causes the exporter to correctly omit timestamps. (#2195)
- Fixed typos in resources.go. (#2201)

## [1.0.0-RC2] - 2021-07-26

### Added

- Added `WithOSDescription` resource configuration option to set OS (Operating System) description resource attribute (`os.description`). (#1840)
- Added `WithOS` resource configuration option to set all OS (Operating System) resource attributes at once. (#1840)
- Added the `WithRetry` option to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp` package.
  This option is a replacement for the removed `WithMaxAttempts` and `WithBackoff` options. (#2095)
- Added API `LinkFromContext` to return Link which encapsulates SpanContext from provided context and also encapsulates attributes. (#2115)
- Added a new `Link` type under the SDK `otel/sdk/trace` package that counts the number of attributes that were dropped for surpassing the `AttributePerLinkCountLimit` configured in the Span's `SpanLimits`.
  This new type replaces the equal-named API `Link` type found in the `otel/trace` package for most usages within the SDK.
  For example, instances of this type are now returned by the `Links()` function of `ReadOnlySpan`s provided in places like the `OnEnd` function of `SpanProcessor` implementations. (#2118)
- Added the `SpanRecorder` type to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/skd/trace/tracetest` package.
  This type can be used with the default SDK as a `SpanProcessor` during testing. (#2132)

### Changed

- The `SpanModels` function is now exported from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/zipkin` package to convert OpenTelemetry spans into Zipkin model spans. (#2027)
- Rename the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc".RetrySettings` to `RetryConfig`. (#2095)

### Deprecated

- The `TextMapCarrier` and `TextMapPropagator` from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/oteltest` package and their associated creation functions (`TextMapCarrier`, `NewTextMapPropagator`) are deprecated. (#2114)
- The `Harness` type from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/oteltest` package and its associated creation function, `NewHarness` are deprecated and will be removed in the next release. (#2123)
- The `TraceStateFromKeyValues` function from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/oteltest` package is deprecated.
  Use the `trace.ParseTraceState` function instead. (#2122)

### Removed

- Removed the deprecated package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/trace/jaeger`. (#2020)
- Removed the deprecated package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/trace/zipkin`. (#2020)
- Removed the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource".WithBuiltinDetectors` function.
  The explicit `With*` options for every built-in detector should be used instead. (#2026 #2097)
- Removed the `WithMaxAttempts` and `WithBackoff` options from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp` package.
  The retry logic of the package has been updated to match the `otlptracegrpc` package and accordingly a `WithRetry` option is added that should be used instead. (#2095)
- Removed `DroppedAttributeCount` field from `otel/trace.Link` struct. (#2118)

### Fixed

- When using WithNewRoot, don't use the parent context for making sampling decisions. (#2032)
- `oteltest.Tracer` now creates a valid `SpanContext` when using `WithNewRoot`. (#2073)
- OS type detector now sets the correct `dragonflybsd` value for DragonFly BSD. (#2092)
- The OTel span status is correctly transformed into the OTLP status in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace` package.
  This fix will by default set the status to `Unset` if it is not explicitly set to `Ok` or `Error`. (#2099 #2102)
- The `Inject` method for the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/propagation".TraceContext` type no longer injects empty `tracestate` values. (#2108)
- Use `6831` as default Jaeger agent port instead of `6832`. (#2131)

## [Experimental Metrics v0.22.0] - 2021-07-19

### Added

- Adds HTTP support for OTLP metrics exporter. (#2022)

### Removed

- Removed the deprecated package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/metric/prometheus`. (#2020)

## [1.0.0-RC1] / 0.21.0 - 2021-06-18

With this release we are introducing a split in module versions.  The tracing API and SDK are entering the `v1.0.0` Release Candidate phase with `v1.0.0-RC1`
while the experimental metrics API and SDK continue with `v0.x` releases at `v0.21.0`.  Modules at major version 1 or greater will not depend on modules
with major version 0.

### Added

- Adds `otlpgrpc.WithRetry`option for configuring the retry policy for transient errors on the otlp/gRPC exporter. (#1832)
  - The following status codes are defined as transient errors:
      | gRPC Status Code | Description |
      | ---------------- | ----------- |
      | 1  | Cancelled |
      | 4  | Deadline Exceeded |
      | 8  | Resource Exhausted |
      | 10 | Aborted |
      | 10 | Out of Range |
      | 14 | Unavailable |
      | 15 | Data Loss |
- Added `Status` type to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` package to represent the status of a span. (#1874)
- Added `SpanStub` type and its associated functions to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace/tracetest` package.
  This type can be used as a testing replacement for the `SpanSnapshot` that was removed from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` package. (#1873)
- Adds support for scheme in `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` according to the spec. (#1886)
- Adds `trace.WithSchemaURL` option for configuring the tracer with a Schema URL. (#1889)
- Added an example of using OpenTelemetry Go as a trace context forwarder. (#1912)
- `ParseTraceState` is added to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` package.
  It can be used to decode a `TraceState` from a `tracestate` header string value. (#1937)
- Added `Len` method to the `TraceState` type in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` package.
  This method returns the number of list-members the `TraceState` holds. (#1937)
- Creates package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace` that defines a trace exporter that uses a `otlptrace.Client` to send data.
  Creates package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc` implementing a gRPC `otlptrace.Client` and offers convenience functions, `NewExportPipeline` and `InstallNewPipeline`, to setup and install a `otlptrace.Exporter` in tracing .(#1922)
- Added `Baggage`, `Member`, and `Property` types to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/baggage` package along with their related functions. (#1967)
- Added `ContextWithBaggage`, `ContextWithoutBaggage`, and `FromContext` functions to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/baggage` package.
  These functions replace the `Set`, `Value`, `ContextWithValue`, `ContextWithoutValue`, and `ContextWithEmpty` functions from that package and directly work with the new `Baggage` type. (#1967)
- The `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable is the preferred source for `service.name`, used by the environment resource detector if a service name is present both there and in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`. (#1969)
- Creates package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp` implementing an HTTP `otlptrace.Client` and offers convenience functions, `NewExportPipeline` and `InstallNewPipeline`, to setup and install a `otlptrace.Exporter` in tracing. (#1963)
- Changes `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource.NewWithAttributes` to require a schema URL. The old function is still available as `resource.NewSchemaless`. This is a breaking change. (#1938)
- Several builtin resource detectors now correctly populate the schema URL. (#1938)
- Creates package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlpmetric` that defines a metrics exporter that uses a `otlpmetric.Client` to send data.
- Creates package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlpmetric/otlpmetricgrpc` implementing a gRPC `otlpmetric.Client` and offers convenience functions, `New` and `NewUnstarted`, to create an `otlpmetric.Exporter`.(#1991)
- Added `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout/stdouttrace` exporter. (#2005)
- Added `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout/stdoutmetric` exporter. (#2005)
- Added a `TracerProvider()` method to the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace".Span` interface. This can be used to obtain a `TracerProvider` from a given span that utilizes the same trace processing pipeline.  (#2009)

### Changed

- Make `NewSplitDriver` from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp` take variadic arguments instead of a `SplitConfig` item.
  `NewSplitDriver` now automatically implements an internal `noopDriver` for `SplitConfig` fields that are not initialized. (#1798)
- `resource.New()` now creates a Resource without builtin detectors. Previous behavior is now achieved by using `WithBuiltinDetectors` Option. (#1810)
- Move the `Event` type from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` package to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` package. (#1846)
- CI builds validate against last two versions of Go, dropping 1.14 and adding 1.16. (#1865)
- BatchSpanProcessor now report export failures when calling `ForceFlush()` method. (#1860)
- `Set.Encoded(Encoder)` no longer caches the result of an encoding. (#1855)
- Renamed `CloudZoneKey` to `CloudAvailabilityZoneKey` in Resource semantic conventions according to spec. (#1871)
- The `StatusCode` and `StatusMessage` methods of the `ReadOnlySpan` interface and the `Span` produced by the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` package have been replaced with a single `Status` method.
  This method returns the status of a span using the new `Status` type. (#1874)
- Updated `ExportSpans` method of the`SpanExporter` interface type to accept `ReadOnlySpan`s instead of the removed `SpanSnapshot`.
  This brings the export interface into compliance with the specification in that it now accepts an explicitly immutable type instead of just an implied one. (#1873)
- Unembed `SpanContext` in `Link`. (#1877)
- Generate Semantic conventions from the specification YAML. (#1891)
- Spans created by the global `Tracer` obtained from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel`, prior to a functioning `TracerProvider` being set, now propagate the span context from their parent if one exists. (#1901)
- The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel".Tracer` function now accepts tracer options. (#1902)
- Move the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/unit` package to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/unit`. (#1903)
- Changed `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace.TracerConfig` to conform to the [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#config.) (#1921)
- Changed `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace.SpanConfig` to conform to the [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#config). (#1921)
- Changed `span.End()` now only accepts Options that are allowed at `End()`. (#1921)
- Changed `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric.InstrumentConfig` to conform to the [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#config). (#1921)
- Changed `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric.MeterConfig` to conform to the [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#config). (#1921)
- Refactored option types according to the contribution style guide. (#1882)
- Move the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace.TraceStateFromKeyValues` function to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/oteltest` package.
  This function is preserved for testing purposes where it may be useful to create a `TraceState` from `attribute.KeyValue`s, but it is not intended for production use.
  The new `ParseTraceState` function should be used to create a `TraceState`. (#1931)
- Updated `MarshalJSON` method of the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace.TraceState` type to marshal the type into the string representation of the `TraceState`. (#1931)
- The `TraceState.Delete` method from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` package no longer returns an error in addition to a `TraceState`. (#1931)
- Updated `Get` method of the `TraceState` type from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` package to accept a `string` instead of an `attribute.Key` type. (#1931)
- Updated `Insert` method of the `TraceState` type from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` package to accept a pair of `string`s instead of an `attribute.KeyValue` type. (#1931)
- Updated `Delete` method of the `TraceState` type from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` package to accept a `string` instead of an `attribute.Key` type. (#1931)
- Renamed `NewExporter` to `New` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout` package. (#1985)
- Renamed `NewExporter` to `New` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/metric/prometheus` package. (#1985)
- Renamed `NewExporter` to `New` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/trace/jaeger` package. (#1985)
- Renamed `NewExporter` to `New` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/trace/zipkin` package. (#1985)
- Renamed `NewExporter` to `New` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp` package. (#1985)
- Renamed `NewUnstartedExporter` to `NewUnstarted` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp` package. (#1985)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv` package has been moved to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.4.0` to allow for multiple [telemetry schema](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/0152-telemetry-schemas.md) versions to be used concurrently. (#1987)
- Metrics test helpers in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/oteltest` have been moved to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/metrictest`. (#1988)

### Deprecated

- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/metric/prometheus` is deprecated, use `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus` instead. (#1993)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/trace/jaeger` is deprecated, use `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/jaeger` instead. (#1993)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/trace/zipkin` is deprecated, use `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/zipkin` instead. (#1993)

### Removed

- Removed `resource.WithoutBuiltin()`. Use `resource.New()`. (#1810)
- Unexported types `resource.FromEnv`, `resource.Host`, and `resource.TelemetrySDK`, Use the corresponding `With*()` to use individually. (#1810)
- Removed the `Tracer` and `IsRecording` method from the `ReadOnlySpan` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace`.
  The `Tracer` method is not a required to be included in this interface and given the mutable nature of the tracer that is associated with a span, this method is not appropriate.
  The `IsRecording` method returns if the span is recording or not.
  A read-only span value does not need to know if updates to it will be recorded or not.
  By definition, it cannot be updated so there is no point in communicating if an update is recorded. (#1873)
- Removed the `SpanSnapshot` type from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` package.
  The use of this type has been replaced with the use of the explicitly immutable `ReadOnlySpan` type.
  When a concrete representation of a read-only span is needed for testing, the newly added `SpanStub` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace/tracetest` package should be used. (#1873)
- Removed the `Tracer` method from the `Span` interface in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` package.
  Using the same tracer that created a span introduces the error where an instrumentation library's `Tracer` is used by other code instead of their own.
  The `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel".Tracer` function or a `TracerProvider` should be used to acquire a library specific `Tracer` instead. (#1900)
  - The `TracerProvider()` method on the `Span` interface may also be used to obtain a `TracerProvider` using the same trace processing pipeline. (#2009)
- The `http.url` attribute generated by `HTTPClientAttributesFromHTTPRequest` will no longer include username or password information. (#1919)
- Removed `IsEmpty` method of the `TraceState` type in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace` package in favor of using the added `TraceState.Len` method. (#1931)
- Removed `Set`, `Value`, `ContextWithValue`, `ContextWithoutValue`, and `ContextWithEmpty` functions in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/baggage` package.
  Handling of baggage is now done using the added `Baggage` type and related context functions (`ContextWithBaggage`, `ContextWithoutBaggage`, and `FromContext`) in that package. (#1967)
- The `InstallNewPipeline` and `NewExportPipeline` creation functions in all the exporters (prometheus, otlp, stdout, jaeger, and zipkin) have been removed.
  These functions were deemed premature attempts to provide convenience that did not achieve this aim. (#1985)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp` exporter has been removed.  Use `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace` instead. (#1990)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout` exporter has been removed.  Use `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout/stdouttrace` or `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout/stdoutmetric` instead. (#2005)

### Fixed

- Only report errors from the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource".Environment` function when they are not `nil`. (#1850, #1851)
- The `Shutdown` method of the simple `SpanProcessor` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` package now honors the context deadline or cancellation. (#1616, #1856)
- BatchSpanProcessor now drops span batches that failed to be exported. (#1860)
- Use `http://localhost:14268/api/traces` as default Jaeger collector endpoint instead of `http://localhost:14250`. (#1898)
- Allow trailing and leading whitespace in the parsing of a `tracestate` header. (#1931)
- Add logic to determine if the channel is closed to fix Jaeger exporter test panic with close closed channel. (#1870, #1973)
- Avoid transport security when OTLP endpoint is a Unix socket. (#2001)

### Security

### Fixed

- The `Span.IsRecording` implementation from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` always returns false when not being sampled. (#1750)
- The Jaeger exporter now correctly sets tags for the Span status code and message.
  This means it uses the correct tag keys (`"otel.status_code"`, `"otel.status_description"`) and does not set the status message as a tag unless it is set on the span. (#1761)
- The Jaeger exporter now correctly records Span event's names using the `"event"` key for a tag.
  Additionally, this tag is overridden, as specified in the OTel specification, if the event contains an attribute with that key. (#1768)
- Zipkin Exporter: Ensure mapping between OTel and Zipkin span data complies with the specification. (#1688)
- Fixed typo for default service name in Jaeger Exporter. (#1797)
- Fix flaky OTLP for the reconnnection of the client connection. (#1527, #1814)
- Fix Jaeger exporter dropping of span batches that exceed the UDP packet size limit.
  Instead, the exporter now splits the batch into smaller sendable batches. (#1828)

### Changed

- Span `RecordError` now records an `exception` event to comply with the semantic convention specification. (#1492)
- Jaeger exporter was updated to use thrift v0.14.1. (#1712)
- Migrate from using internally built and maintained version of the OTLP to the one hosted at `go.opentelemetry.io/proto/otlp`. (#1713)
- Migrate from using `github.com/gogo/protobuf` to `google.golang.org/protobuf` to match `go.opentelemetry.io/proto/otlp`. (#1713)
- The storage of a local or remote Span in a `context.Context` using its SpanContext is unified to store just the current Span.
  The Span's SpanContext can now self-identify as being remote or not.
  This means that `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace".ContextWithRemoteSpanContext` will now overwrite any existing current Span, not just existing remote Spans, and make it the current Span in a `context.Context`. (#1731)
- Improve OTLP/gRPC exporter connection errors. (#1737)
- Information about a parent span context in a `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/export/trace".SpanSnapshot` is unified in a new `Parent` field.
  The existing `ParentSpanID` and `HasRemoteParent` fields are removed in favor of this. (#1748)
- The `ParentContext` field of the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace".SamplingParameters` is updated to hold a `context.Context` containing the parent span.
  This changes it to make `SamplingParameters` conform with the OpenTelemetry specification. (#1749)
- Updated Jaeger Environment Variables: `JAEGER_ENDPOINT`, `JAEGER_USER`, `JAEGER_PASSWORD`
  to `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_USER`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_PASSWORD` in compliance with OTel specification. (#1752)
- Modify `BatchSpanProcessor.ForceFlush` to abort after timeout/cancellation. (#1757)
- The `DroppedAttributeCount` field of the `Span` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` package now only represents the number of attributes dropped for the span itself.
  It no longer is a conglomerate of itself, events, and link attributes that have been dropped. (#1771)
- Make `ExportSpans` in Jaeger Exporter honor context deadline. (#1773)
- Modify Zipkin Exporter default service name, use default resource's serviceName instead of empty. (#1777)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/export/trace` package is merged into the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` package. (#1778)
- The prometheus.InstallNewPipeline example is moved from comment to example test (#1796)
- The convenience functions for the stdout exporter have been updated to return the `TracerProvider` implementation and enable the shutdown of the exporter. (#1800)
- Replace the flush function returned from the Jaeger exporter's convenience creation functions (`InstallNewPipeline` and `NewExportPipeline`) with the `TracerProvider` implementation they create.
  This enables the caller to shutdown and flush using the related `TracerProvider` methods. (#1822)
- Updated the Jaeger exporter to have a default endpoint, `http://localhost:14250`, for the collector. (#1824)
- Changed the function `WithCollectorEndpoint` in the Jaeger exporter to no longer accept an endpoint as an argument.
  The endpoint can be passed with the `CollectorEndpointOption` using the `WithEndpoint` function or by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT` environment variable value appropriately. (#1824)
- The Jaeger exporter no longer batches exported spans itself, instead it relies on the SDK's `BatchSpanProcessor` for this functionality. (#1830)
- The Jaeger exporter creation functions (`NewRawExporter`, `NewExportPipeline`, and `InstallNewPipeline`) no longer accept the removed `Option` type as a variadic argument. (#1830)

### Removed

- Removed Jaeger Environment variables: `JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME`, `JAEGER_DISABLED`, `JAEGER_TAGS`
  These environment variables will no longer be used to override values of the Jaeger exporter (#1752)
- No longer set the links for a `Span` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` that is configured to be a new root.
  This is unspecified behavior that the OpenTelemetry community plans to standardize in the future.
  To prevent backwards incompatible changes when it is specified, these links are removed. (#1726)
- Setting error status while recording error with Span from oteltest package. (#1729)
- The concept of a remote and local Span stored in a context is unified to just the current Span.
  Because of this `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace".RemoteSpanContextFromContext` is removed as it is no longer needed.
  Instead, `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace".SpanContextFromContext` can be used to return the current Span.
  If needed, that Span's `SpanContext.IsRemote()` can then be used to determine if it is remote or not. (#1731)
- The `HasRemoteParent` field of the `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace".SamplingParameters` is removed.
  This field is redundant to the information returned from the `Remote` method of the `SpanContext` held in the `ParentContext` field. (#1749)
- The `trace.FlagsDebug` and `trace.FlagsDeferred` constants have been removed and will be localized to the B3 propagator. (#1770)
- Remove `Process` configuration, `WithProcessFromEnv` and `ProcessFromEnv`, and type from the Jaeger exporter package.
  The information that could be configured in the `Process` struct should be configured in a `Resource` instead. (#1776, #1804)
- Remove the `WithDisabled` option from the Jaeger exporter.
  To disable the exporter unregister it from the `TracerProvider` or use a no-operation `TracerProvider`. (#1806)
- Removed the functions `CollectorEndpointFromEnv` and `WithCollectorEndpointOptionFromEnv` from the Jaeger exporter.
  These functions for retrieving specific environment variable values are redundant of other internal functions and
  are not intended for end user use. (#1824)
- Removed the Jaeger exporter `WithSDKOptions` `Option`.
  This option was used to set SDK options for the exporter creation convenience functions.
  These functions are provided as a way to easily setup or install the exporter with what are deemed reasonable SDK settings for common use cases.
  If the SDK needs to be configured differently, the `NewRawExporter` function and direct setup of the SDK with the desired settings should be used. (#1825)
- The `WithBufferMaxCount` and `WithBatchMaxCount` `Option`s from the Jaeger exporter are removed.
  The exporter no longer batches exports, instead relying on the SDK's `BatchSpanProcessor` for this functionality. (#1830)
- The Jaeger exporter `Option` type is removed.
  The type is no longer used by the exporter to configure anything.
  All the previous configurations these options provided were duplicates of SDK configuration.
  They have been removed in favor of using the SDK configuration and focuses the exporter configuration to be only about the endpoints it will send telemetry to. (#1830)

  - supports configurable aggregation temporality (default: Cumulative, optional: Stateless). (#1296)
- The Sampler is now called on local child spans. (#1233)
- The `Kind` type from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/metric` package was renamed to `InstrumentKind` to more specifically describe what it is and avoid semantic ambiguity. (#1240)
- The `MetricKind` method of the `Descriptor` type in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/metric` package was renamed to `Descriptor.InstrumentKind`.

- The `AddEventWithTimestamp` method on the `Span` interface in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` is removed due to its redundancy.
   It is replaced by using the `AddEvent` method with a `WithTimestamp` option. (#1254)
- The `MockSpan` and `MockTracer` types are removed from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/oteltest`.
   `Tracer` and `Span` from the same module should be used in their place instead. (#1306)
- `WorkerCount` option is removed from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp`. (#1350)
- Remove the following labels types: INT32, UINT32, UINT64 and FLOAT32. (#1314)

### Fixed

- Rename `MergeItererator` to `MergeIterator` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/label` package. (#1244)

- The `StatusCode` field of the `SpanData` struct in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/export/trace` package now uses the codes package from this package instead of the gRPC project. (#1214)
- Move the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/baggage` package into `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/baggage`. (#1217) (#1325)
- A `Shutdown` method of `SpanProcessor` and all its implementations receives a context and returns an error. (#1264)

### Fixed

- Copies of data from arrays and slices passed to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/label.ArrayValue()` are now used in the returned `Value` instead of using the mutable data itself. (#1226)

### Removed

- The `ExtractHTTP` and `InjectHTTP` functions from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/propagation` package were removed. (#1212)
- The `Propagators` interface from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/propagation` package was removed to conform to the OpenTelemetry specification.
   The explicit `TextMapPropagator` type can be used in its place as this is the `Propagator` type the specification defines. (#1212)
- The `SetAttribute` method of the `Span` from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace` package was removed given its redundancy with the `SetAttributes` method. (#1216)
- The internal implementation of Baggage storage is removed in favor of using the new Baggage API functionality. (#1217)
- Remove duplicate hostname key `HostHostNameKey` in Resource semantic conventions. (#1219)
- Nested array/slice support has been removed. (#1226)

## [0.12.0] - 2020-09-24

### Added

- A `SpanConfigure` function in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace` to create a new `SpanConfig` from `SpanOption`s. (#1108)
- In the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace` package, `NewTracerConfig` was added to construct new `TracerConfig`s.
   This addition was made to conform with our project option conventions. (#1155)
- Instrumentation library information was added to the Zipkin exporter. (#1119)
- The `SpanProcessor` interface now has a `ForceFlush()` method. (#1166)
- More semantic conventions for k8s as resource attributes. (#1167)

### Changed

- Add reconnecting udp connection type to Jaeger exporter.
   This change adds a new optional implementation of the udp conn interface used to detect changes to an agent's host dns record.
   It then adopts the new destination address to ensure the exporter doesn't get stuck. This change was ported from jaegertracing/jaeger-client-go#520. (#1063)
- Replace `StartOption` and `EndOption` in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace` with `SpanOption`.
   This change is matched by replacing the `StartConfig` and `EndConfig` with a unified `SpanConfig`. (#1108)
- Replace the `LinkedTo` span option in `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace` with `WithLinks`.
   This is be more consistent with our other option patterns, i.e. passing the item to be configured directly instead of its component parts, and provides a cleaner function signature. (#1108)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace` `TracerOption` was changed to an interface to conform to project option conventions. (#1109)
- Move the `B3` and `TraceContext` from within the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace` package to their own `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/propagators` package.
    This removal of the propagators is reflective of the OpenTelemetry specification for these propagators as well as cleans up the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace` API. (#1118)
- Rename Jaeger tags used for instrumentation library information to reflect changes in OpenTelemetry specification. (#1119)
- Rename `ProbabilitySampler` to `TraceIDRatioBased` and change semantics to ignore parent span sampling status. (#1115)
- Move `tools` package under `internal`. (#1141)
- Move `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/correlation` package to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/baggage`. (#1142)
   The `correlation.CorrelationContext` propagator has been renamed `baggage.Baggage`.  Other exported functions and types are unchanged.
- Rename `ParentOrElse` sampler to `ParentBased` and allow setting samplers depending on parent span. (#1153)
- In the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace` package, `SpanConfigure` was renamed to `NewSpanConfig`. (#1155)
- Change `dependabot.yml` to add a `Skip Changelog` label to dependabot-sourced PRs. (#1161)
- The [configuration style guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#config) has been updated to
   recommend the use of `newConfig()` instead of `configure()`. (#1163)
- The `otlp.Config` type has been unexported and changed to `otlp.config`, along with its initializer. (#1163)
- Ensure exported interface types include parameter names and update the
   Style Guide to reflect this styling rule. (#1172)
- Don't consider unset environment variable for resource detection to be an error. (#1170)
- Rename `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/metric.ConfigureInstrument` to `NewInstrumentConfig` and
  `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/metric.ConfigureMeter` to `NewMeterConfig`.
- ValueObserver instruments use LastValue aggregator by default. (#1165)
- OTLP Metric exporter supports LastValue aggregation. (#1165)
- Move the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/unit` package to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/unit`. (#1185)
- Rename `Provider` to `MeterProvider` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/metric` package. (#1190)
- Rename `NoopProvider` to `NoopMeterProvider` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/metric` package. (#1190)

- Rename `Provider` to `TracerProvider` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace/tracetest` package. (#1190)
- Rename `NewProvider` to `NewTracerProvider` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/trace/tracetest` package. (#1190)
- Rename `WrapperProvider` to `WrapperTracerProvider` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/bridge/opentracing` package. (#1190)
- Rename `NewWrapperProvider` to `NewWrapperTracerProvider` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/bridge/opentracing` package. (#1190)

   `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/propagators/` module. (#1191)
- Remove the semantic convention for HTTP status text, `HTTPStatusTextKey` from package `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv`. (#1194)

### Fixed

- Zipkin example no longer mentions `ParentSampler`, corrected to `ParentBased`. (#1171)
- Fix missing shutdown processor in otel-collector example. (#1186)
- Fix missing shutdown processor in basic and namedtracer examples. (#1197)

## [0.11.0] - 2020-08-24

### Added

- Support for exporting array-valued attributes via OTLP. (#992)
- `Noop` and `InMemory` `SpanBatcher` implementations to help with testing integrations. (#994)
- Support for filtering metric label sets. (#1047)
- A dimensionality-reducing metric Processor. (#1057)
- Integration tests for more OTel Collector Attribute types. (#1062)
- A new `WithSpanProcessor` `ProviderOption` is added to the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` package to create a `Provider` and automatically register the `SpanProcessor`. (#1078)

### Changed

- Rename `sdk/metric/processor/test` to `sdk/metric/processor/processortest`. (#1049)
- Rename `sdk/metric/controller/test` to `sdk/metric/controller/controllertest`. (#1049)
- Rename `api/testharness` to `api/apitest`. (#1049)
- Rename `api/trace/testtrace` to `api/trace/tracetest`. (#1049)
- Change Metric Processor to merge multiple observations. (#1024)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/bridge/opentracing` bridge package has been made into its own module.
   This removes the package dependencies of this bridge from the rest of the OpenTelemetry based project. (#1038)
- Renamed `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/standard` package to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv` to avoid the ambiguous and generic name `standard` and better describe the package as containing OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. (#1016)
- The environment variable used for resource detection has been changed from `OTEL_RESOURCE_LABELS` to `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` (#1042)
- Replace `WithSyncer` with `WithBatcher` in examples. (#1044)
- Replace the `google.golang.org/grpc/codes` dependency in the API with an equivalent `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/codes` package. (#1046)
- Merge the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/label` and `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/kv` into the new `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/label` package. (#1060)
- Unify Callback Function Naming.
   Rename `*Callback` with `*Func`. (#1061)
- CI builds validate against last two versions of Go, dropping 1.13 and adding 1.15. (#1064)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/export/trace` interfaces `SpanSyncer` and `SpanBatcher` have been replaced with a specification compliant `Exporter` interface.
   This interface still supports the export of `SpanData`, but only as a slice.
   Implementation are also required now to return any error from `ExportSpans` if one occurs as well as implement a `Shutdown` method for exporter clean-up. (#1078)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` `NewBatchSpanProcessor` function no longer returns an error.
   If a `nil` exporter is passed as an argument to this function, instead of it returning an error, it now returns a `BatchSpanProcessor` that handles the export of `SpanData` by not taking any action. (#1078)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` `NewProvider` function to create a `Provider` no longer returns an error, instead only a `*Provider`.
   This change is related to `NewBatchSpanProcessor` not returning an error which was the only error this function would return. (#1078)

### Removed

- Duplicate, unused API sampler interface. (#999)
   Use the [`Sampler` interface](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/v0.11.0/sdk/trace/sampling.go) provided by the SDK instead.
- The `grpctrace` instrumentation was moved to the `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib` repository and out of this repository.
   This move includes moving the `grpc` example to the `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib` as well. (#1027)
- The `WithSpan` method of the `Tracer` interface.
   The functionality this method provided was limited compared to what a user can provide themselves.
   It was removed with the understanding that if there is sufficient user need it can be added back based on actual user usage. (#1043)
- The `RegisterSpanProcessor` and `UnregisterSpanProcessor` functions.
   These were holdovers from an approach prior to the TracerProvider design. They were not used anymore. (#1077)
- The `oterror` package. (#1026)
- The `othttp` and `httptrace` instrumentations were moved to `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib`. (#1032)

### Fixed

- The `semconv.HTTPServerMetricAttributesFromHTTPRequest()` function no longer generates the high-cardinality `http.request.content.length` label. (#1031)
- Correct instrumentation version tag in Jaeger exporter. (#1037)
- The SDK span will now set an error event if the `End` method is called during a panic (i.e. it was deferred). (#1043)
- Move internally generated protobuf code from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` to the OTLP exporter to reduce dependency overhead. (#1050)
- The `otel-collector` example referenced outdated collector processors. (#1006)

## [0.10.0] - 2020-07-29

This release migrates the default OpenTelemetry SDK into its own Go module, decoupling the SDK from the API and reducing dependencies for instrumentation packages.

### Added

- The Zipkin exporter now has `NewExportPipeline` and `InstallNewPipeline` constructor functions to match the common pattern.
    These function build a new exporter with default SDK options and register the exporter with the `global` package respectively. (#944)
- Add propagator option for gRPC instrumentation. (#986)
- The `testtrace` package now tracks the `trace.SpanKind` for each span. (#987)

### Changed

- Replace the `RegisterGlobal` `Option` in the Jaeger exporter with an `InstallNewPipeline` constructor function.
   This matches the other exporter constructor patterns and will register a new exporter after building it with default configuration. (#944)
- The trace (`go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/trace/stdout`) and metric (`go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/metric/stdout`) `stdout` exporters are now merged into a single exporter at `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout`.
   This new exporter was made into its own Go module to follow the pattern of all exporters and decouple it from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` module. (#956, #963)
- Move the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/test` test package to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/export/metric/metrictest`. (#962)
- The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/kv/value` package was merged into the parent `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/kv` package. (#968)
  - `value.Bool` was replaced with `kv.BoolValue`.
  - `value.Int64` was replaced with `kv.Int64Value`.
  - `value.Uint64` was replaced with `kv.Uint64Value`.
  - `value.Float64` was replaced with `kv.Float64Value`.
  - `value.Int32` was replaced with `kv.Int32Value`.
  - `value.Uint32` was replaced with `kv.Uint32Value`.
  - `value.Float32` was replaced with `kv.Float32Value`.
  - `value.String` was replaced with `kv.StringValue`.
  - `value.Int` was replaced with `kv.IntValue`.
  - `value.Uint` was replaced with `kv.UintValue`.
  - `value.Array` was replaced with `kv.ArrayValue`.
- Rename `Infer` to `Any` in the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/kv` package. (#972)
- Change `othttp` to use the `httpsnoop` package to wrap the `ResponseWriter` so that optional interfaces (`http.Hijacker`, `http.Flusher`, etc.) that are implemented by the original `ResponseWriter`are also implemented by the wrapped `ResponseWriter`. (#979)
- Rename `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric/aggregator/test` package to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric/aggregator/aggregatortest`. (#980)
- Make the SDK into its own Go module called `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk`. (#985)
- Changed the default trace `Sampler` from `AlwaysOn` to `ParentOrElse(AlwaysOn)`. (#989)

### Removed

- The `IndexedAttribute` function from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/label` package was removed in favor of `IndexedLabel` which it was synonymous with. (#970)

### Fixed

- Bump github.com/golangci/golangci-lint from 1.28.3 to 1.29.0 in /tools. (#953)
- Bump github.com/google/go-cmp from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1. (#957)
- Use `global.Handle` for span export errors in the OTLP exporter. (#946)
- Correct Go language formatting in the README documentation. (#961)
- Remove default SDK dependencies from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api` package. (#977)
- Remove default SDK dependencies from the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/instrumentation` package. (#983)
- Move documented examples for `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/instrumentation/grpctrace` interceptors into Go example tests. (#984)

## [0.9.0] - 2020-07-20

### Added

- A new Resource Detector interface is included to allow resources to be automatically detected and included. (#939)
- A Detector to automatically detect resources from an environment variable. (#939)
- Github action to generate protobuf Go bindings locally in `internal/opentelemetry-proto-gen`. (#938)
- OTLP .proto files from `open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto` imported as a git submodule under `internal/opentelemetry-proto`.
   References to `github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto` changed to `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/internal/opentelemetry-proto-gen`. (#942)

### Changed

- Non-nil value `struct`s for key-value pairs will be marshalled using JSON rather than `Sprintf`. (#948)

### Removed

- Removed dependency on `github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector`. (#943)

## [0.8.0] - 2020-07-09

### Added

- The `B3Encoding` type to represent the B3 encoding(s) the B3 propagator can inject.
   A value for HTTP supported encodings (Multiple Header: `MultipleHeader`, Single Header: `SingleHeader`) are included. (#882)
- The `FlagsDeferred` trace flag to indicate if the trace sampling decision has been deferred. (#882)
- The `FlagsDebug` trace flag to indicate if the trace is a debug trace. (#882)
- Add `peer.service` semantic attribute. (#898)
- Add database-specific semantic attributes. (#899)
- Add semantic convention for `faas.coldstart` and `container.id`. (#909)
- Add http content size semantic conventions. (#905)
- Include `http.request_content_length` in HTTP request basic attributes. (#905)
- Add semantic conventions for operating system process resource attribute keys. (#919)
- The Jaeger exporter now has a `WithBatchMaxCount` option to specify the maximum number of spans sent in a batch. (#931)

### Changed

- Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` to ask for updates to `CHANGELOG.md` with each pull request. (#879)
- Use lowercase header names for B3 Multiple Headers. (#881)
- The B3 propagator `SingleHeader` field has been replaced with `InjectEncoding`.
   This new field can be set to combinations of the `B3Encoding` bitmasks and will inject trace information in these encodings.
   If no encoding is set, the propagator will default to `MultipleHeader` encoding. (#882)
- The B3 propagator now extracts from either HTTP encoding of B3 (Single Header or Multiple Header) based on what is contained in the header.
   Preference is given to Single Header encoding with Multiple Header being the fallback if Single Header is not found or is invalid.
   This behavior change is made to dynamically support all correctly encoded traces received instead of having to guess the expected encoding prior to receiving. (#882)
- Extend semantic conventions for RPC. (#900)
- To match constant naming conventions in the `api/standard` package, the `FaaS*` key names are appended with a suffix of `Key`. (#920)
  - `"api/standard".FaaSName` -> `FaaSNameKey`
  - `"api/standard".FaaSID` -> `FaaSIDKey`
  - `"api/standard".FaaSVersion` -> `FaaSVersionKey`
  - `"api/standard".FaaSInstance` -> `FaaSInstanceKey`

### Removed

- The `FlagsUnused` trace flag is removed.
   The purpose of this flag was to act as the inverse of `FlagsSampled`, the inverse of `FlagsSampled` is used instead. (#882)
- The B3 header constants (`B3SingleHeader`, `B3DebugFlagHeader`, `B3TraceIDHeader`, `B3SpanIDHeader`, `B3SampledHeader`, `B3ParentSpanIDHeader`) are removed.
   If B3 header keys are needed [the authoritative OpenZipkin package constants](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-go@v0.2.2/propagation/b3?tab=doc#pkg-constants) should be used instead. (#882)

### Fixed

- The B3 Single Header name is now correctly `b3` instead of the previous `X-B3`. (#881)
- The B3 propagator now correctly supports sampling only values (`b3: 0`, `b3: 1`, or `b3: d`) for a Single B3 Header. (#882)
- The B3 propagator now propagates the debug flag.
   This removes the behavior of changing the debug flag into a set sampling bit.
   Instead, this now follow the B3 specification and omits the `X-B3-Sampling` header. (#882)
- The B3 propagator now tracks "unset" sampling state (meaning "defer the decision") and does not set the `X-B3-Sampling` header when injecting. (#882)
- Bump github.com/itchyny/gojq from 0.10.3 to 0.10.4 in /tools. (#883)
- Bump github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go from v1.1.1-0.20190913142402-a7454ce5950e to v1.2.0. (#885)
- The tracing time conversion for OTLP spans is now correctly set to `UnixNano`. (#896)
- Ensure span status is not set to `Unknown` when no HTTP status code is provided as it is assumed to be `200 OK`. (#908)
- Ensure `httptrace.clientTracer` closes `http.headers` span. (#912)
- Prometheus exporter will not apply stale updates or forget inactive metrics. (#903)
- Add test for api.standard `HTTPClientAttributesFromHTTPRequest`. (#905)
- Bump github.com/golangci/golangci-lint from 1.27.0 to 1.28.1 in /tools. (#901, #913)
- Update otel-collector example to use the v0.5.0 collector. (#915)
- The `grpctrace` instrumentation uses a span name conforming to the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions (does not contain a leading slash (`/`)). (#922)
- The `grpctrace` instrumentation includes an `rpc.method` attribute now set to the gRPC method name. (#900, #922)
- The `grpctrace` instrumentation `rpc.service` attribute now contains the package name if one exists.
   This is in accordance with OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. (#922)
- Correlation Context extractor will no longer insert an empty map into the returned context when no valid values are extracted. (#923)
- Bump google.golang.org/api from 0.28.0 to 0.29.0 in /exporters/trace/jaeger. (#925)
- Bump github.com/itchyny/gojq from 0.10.4 to 0.11.0 in /tools. (#926)
- Bump github.com/golangci/golangci-lint from 1.28.1 to 1.28.2 in /tools. (#930)

## [0.7.0] - 2020-06-26

This release implements the v0.5.0 version of the OpenTelemetry specification.

### Added

- The othttp instrumentation now includes default metrics. (#861)
- This CHANGELOG file to track all changes in the project going forward.
- Support for array type attributes. (#798)
- Apply transitive dependabot go.mod dependency updates as part of a new automatic Github workflow. (#844)
- Timestamps are now passed to exporters for each export. (#835)
- Add new `Accumulation` type to metric SDK to transport telemetry from `Accumulator`s to `Processor`s.
   This replaces the prior `Record` `struct` use for this purpose. (#835)
- New dependabot integration to automate package upgrades. (#814)
- `Meter` and `Tracer` implementations accept instrumentation version version as an optional argument.
   This instrumentation version is passed on to exporters. (#811) (#805) (#802)
- The OTLP exporter includes the instrumentation version in telemetry it exports. (#811)
- Environment variables for Jaeger exporter are supported. (#796)
- New `aggregation.Kind` in the export metric API. (#808)
- New example that uses OTLP and the collector. (#790)
- Handle errors in the span `SetName` during span initialization. (#791)
- Default service config to enable retries for retry-able failed requests in the OTLP exporter and an option to override this default. (#777)
- New `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/oterror` package to uniformly support error handling and definitions for the project. (#778)
- New `global` default implementation of the `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/api/oterror.Handler` interface to be used to handle errors prior to an user defined `Handler`.
   There is also functionality for the user to register their `Handler` as well as a convenience function `Handle` to handle an error with this global `Handler`(#778)
- Options to specify propagators for httptrace and grpctrace instrumentation. (#784)
- The required `application/json` header for the Zipkin exporter is included in all exports. (#774)
- Integrate HTTP semantics helpers from the contrib repository into the `api/standard` package. #769

### Changed

- Rename `Integrator` to `Processor` in the metric SDK. (#863)
- Rename `AggregationSelector` to `AggregatorSelector`. (#859)
- Rename `SynchronizedCopy` to `SynchronizedMove`. (#858)
- Rename `simple` integrator to `basic` integrator. (#857)
- Merge otlp collector examples. (#841)
- Change the metric SDK to support cumulative, delta, and pass-through exporters directly.
   With these changes, cumulative and delta specific exporters are able to request the correct kind of aggregation from the SDK. (#840)
- The `Aggregator.Checkpoint` API is renamed to `SynchronizedCopy` and adds an argument, a different `Aggregator` into which the copy is stored. (#812)
- The `export.Aggregator` contract is that `Update()` and `SynchronizedCopy()` are synchronized with each other.
   All the aggregation interfaces (`Sum`, `LastValue`, ...) are not meant to be synchronized, as the caller is expected to synchronize aggregators at a higher level after the `Accumulator`.
   Some of the `Aggregators` used unnecessary locking and that has been cleaned up. (#812)
- Use of `metric.Number` was replaced by `int64` now that we use `sync.Mutex` in the `MinMaxSumCount` and `Histogram` `Aggregators`. (#812)
- Replace `AlwaysParentSample` with `ParentSample(fallback)` to match the OpenTelemetry v0.5.0 specification. (#810)
- Rename `sdk/export/metric/aggregator` to `sdk/export/metric/aggregation`. #808
- Send configured headers with every request in the OTLP exporter, instead of just on connection creation. (#806)
- Update error handling for any one off error handlers, replacing, instead, with the `global.Handle` function. (#791)
- Rename `plugin` directory to `instrumentation` to match the OpenTelemetry specification. (#779)
- Makes the argument order to Histogram and DDSketch `New()` consistent. (#781)

### Removed

- Scripts to better automate the release process. (#576)

### Changed

- Default to to use `AlwaysSampler` instead of `ProbabilitySampler` to match OpenTelemetry specification. (#506)
- Renamed `AlwaysSampleSampler` to `AlwaysOnSampler` in the trace API. (#511)
- Renamed `NeverSampleSampler` to `AlwaysOffSampler` in the trace API. (#511)
- The `Status` field of the `Span` was changed to `StatusCode` to disambiguate with the added `StatusMessage`. (#524)
- Updated the trace `Sampler` interface conform to the OpenTelemetry specification. (#531)
- Rename metric API `Options` to `Config`. (#541)
- Rename metric `Counter` aggregator to be `Sum`. (#541)
- Unify metric options into `Option` from instrument specific options. (#541)
- The trace API's `TraceProvider` now support `Resource`s. (#545)
- Correct error in zipkin module name. (#548)
- The jaeger trace exporter now supports `Resource`s. (#551)
- Metric SDK now supports `Resource`s.
   The `WithResource` option was added to configure a `Resource` on creation and the `Resource` method was added to the metric `Descriptor` to return the associated `Resource`. (#552)
- Replace `ErrNoLastValue` and `ErrEmptyDataSet` by `ErrNoData` in the metric SDK. (#557)
- The stdout trace exporter now supports `Resource`s. (#558)
- The metric `Descriptor` is now included at the API instead of the SDK. (#560)
- Replace `Ordered` with an iterator in `export.Labels`. (#567)

### Removed

- The vendor specific Stackdriver. It is now hosted on 3rd party vendor infrastructure. (#452)
- The `Unregister` method for metric observers as it is not in the OpenTelemetry specification. (#560)
- `GetDescriptor` from the metric SDK. (#575)
- The `Gauge` instrument from the metric API. (#537)

### Fixed

- Make histogram aggregator checkpoint consistent. (#438)
- Update README with import instructions and how to build and test. (#505)
- The default label encoding was updated to be unique. (#508)
- Use `NewRoot` in the othttp plugin for public endpoints. (#513)
- Fix data race in `BatchedSpanProcessor`. (#518)
- Skip test-386 for Mac OS 10.15.x (Catalina and upwards). #521

- Encode labels once during checkpoint.
   The checkpoint function is executed in a single thread so we can do the encoding lazily before passing the encoded version of labels to the exporter.
   This is a cheap and quick way to avoid encoding the labels on every collection interval. (#572)
- Run coverage over all packages in `COVERAGE_MOD_DIR`. (#573)

## [0.2.3] - 2020-03-04

### Added

- `RecordError` method on `Span`s in the trace API to Simplify adding error events to spans. (#473)
- Configurable push frequency for exporters setup pipeline. (#504)

### Changed

- Rename the `exporter` directory to `exporters`.
   The `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporter/trace/jaeger` package was mistakenly released with a `v1.0.0` tag instead of `v0.1.0`.
   This resulted in all subsequent releases not becoming the default latest.
   A consequence of this was that all `go get`s pulled in the incompatible `v0.1.0` release of that package when pulling in more recent packages from other otel packages.
   Renaming the `exporter` directory to `exporters` fixes this issue by renaming the package and therefore clearing any existing dependency tags.
   Consequentially, this action also renames *all* exporter packages. (#502)

### Removed

- The `CorrelationContextHeader` constant in the `correlation` package is no longer exported. (#503)

## [0.2.2] - 2020-02-27

### Added

- `DefaultPropagator` function and have it return `trace.TraceContext` as the default context propagator. (#456)
- `AlwaysParentSample` sampler to the trace API. (#455)

- Run the race checker for all test. (#354)
- Redundant commands in the Makefile are removed. (#354)
- Split the `generate` and `lint` targets of the Makefile. (#354)
- Renames `circle-ci` target to more generic `ci` in Makefile. (#354)
- Add example Prometheus binary to gitignore. (#358)
- Support negative numbers with the `MaxSumCount`. (#335)
- Resolve race conditions in `push_test.go` identified in #339. (#340)
- Use `/usr/bin/env bash` as a shebang in scripts rather than `/bin/bash`. (#336)
- Trace benchmark now tests both `AlwaysSample` and `NeverSample`.
   Previously it was testing `AlwaysSample` twice. (#325)
- Trace benchmark now uses a `[]byte` for `TraceID` to fix failing test. (#325)
- Added a trace benchmark to test variadic functions in `setAttribute` vs `setAttributes` (#325)
- The `defaultkeys` batcher was only using the encoded label set as its map key while building a checkpoint.
   This allowed distinct label sets through, but any metrics sharing a label set could be overwritten or merged incorrectly.
   This was corrected. (#333)

## [0.1.2] - 2019-11-18

### Fixed

- Optimized the `simplelru` map for attributes to reduce the number of allocations. (#328)
- Removed unnecessary unslicing of parameters that are already a slice. (#324)

## [0.1.1] - 2019-11-18

This release contains a Metrics SDK with stdout exporter and supports basic aggregations such as counter, gauges, array, maxsumcount, and ddsketch.

### Added

- Metrics stdout export pipeline. (#265)
- Array aggregation for raw measure metrics. (#282)
- The core.Value now have a `MarshalJSON` method. (#281)

### Removed

- `WithService`, `WithResources`, and `WithComponent` methods of tracers. (#314)
- Prefix slash in `Tracer.Start()` for the Jaeger example. (#292)

### Changed

- Allocation in LabelSet construction to reduce GC overhead. (#318)
- `trace.WithAttributes` to append values instead of replacing (#315)
- Use a formula for tolerance in sampling tests. (#298)
- Move export types into trace and metric-specific sub-directories. (#289)
- `SpanKind` back to being based on an `int` type. (#288)

### Fixed

- URL to OpenTelemetry website in README. (#323)
- Name of othttp default tracer. (#321)
- `ExportSpans` for the stackdriver exporter now handles `nil` context. (#294)
- CI modules cache to correctly restore/save from/to the cache. (#316)
- Fix metric SDK race condition between `LoadOrStore` and the assignment `rec.recorder = i.meter.exporter.AggregatorFor(rec)`. (#293)
- README now reflects the new code structure introduced with these changes. (#291)
- Make the basic example work. (#279)

## [0.1.0] - 2019-11-04

This is the first release of open-telemetry go library.
It contains api and sdk for trace and meter.

### Added

- Initial OpenTelemetry trace and metric API prototypes.
- Initial OpenTelemetry trace, metric, and export SDK packages.
- A wireframe bridge to support compatibility with OpenTracing.
- Example code for a basic, http-stackdriver, http, jaeger, and named tracer setup.
- Exporters for Jaeger, Stackdriver, and stdout.
- Propagators for binary, B3, and trace-context protocols.
- Project information and guidelines in the form of a README and CONTRIBUTING.
- Tools to build the project and a Makefile to automate the process.
- Apache-2.0 license.
