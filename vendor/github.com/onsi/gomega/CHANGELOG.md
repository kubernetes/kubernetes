### Features

Introducting [gcustom](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/#gcustom-a-convenient-mechanism-for-buildling-custom-matchers) - a convenient mechanism for building custom matchers.

This is an RC release for `gcustom`.  The external API may be tweaked in response to feedback however it is expected to remain mostly stable.

### Maintenance

- Update BeComparableTo documentation [756eaa0]

## 1.23.0

### Features
- Custom formatting on a per-type basis can be provided using `format.RegisterCustomFormatter()` -- see the docs [here](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/#adjusting-output)

- Substantial improvement have been made to `StopTrying()`:
  - Users can now use `StopTrying().Wrap(err)` to wrap errors and `StopTrying().Attach(description, object)` to attach arbitrary objects to the `StopTrying()` error
  - `StopTrying()` is now always interpreted as a failure.  If you are an early adopter of `StopTrying()` you may need to change your code as the prior version would match against the returned value even if `StopTrying()` was returned.  Going forward the `StopTrying()` api should remain stable.
  - `StopTrying()` and `StopTrying().Now()` can both be used in matchers - not just polled functions.

- `TryAgainAfter(duration)` is used like `StopTrying()` but instructs `Eventually` and `Consistently` that the poll should be tried again after the specified duration.  This allows you to dynamically adjust the polling duration.

- `ctx` can now be passed-in as the first argument to `Eventually` and `Consistently`.

## 1.22.0

### Features

Several improvements have been made to `Eventually` and `Consistently` in this and the most recent releases:

  This enables integration with Ginkgo 2.3.0's interruptible nodes and node timeouts.
- Eventually and Consistently that are passed a SpecContext can provide reports when an interrupt occurs [0d063c9]
- Eventually/Consistently will forward an attached context to functions that ask for one [e2091c5]
- Eventually/Consistently supports passing arguments to functions via WithArguments() [a2dc7c3]
- Eventually and Consistently can now be stopped early with StopTrying(message) and StopTrying(message).Now() [52976bb]

- feat: formatter for HTTP responses (#461) [e5b3157]

## 1.15.0

### Fixes
The previous version (1.14.0) introduced a change to allow `Eventually` and `Consistently` to support functions that make assertions.  This was accomplished by overriding the global fail handler when running the callbacks passed to `Eventually/Consistently` in order to capture any resulting errors.  Issue #457 uncovered a flaw with this approach: when multiple `Eventually`s are running concurrently they race when overriding the singleton global fail handler.

1.15.0 resolves this by requiring users who want to make assertions in `Eventually/Consistently` call backs to explicitly pass in a function that takes a `Gomega` as an argument.  The passed-in `Gomega` instance can be used to make assertions.  Any failures will cause `Eventually` to retry the callback.  This cleaner interface avoids the issue of swapping out globals but comes at the cost of changing the contract introduced in v1.14.0.  As such 1.15.0 introduces a breaking change with respect to 1.14.0 - however we expect that adoption of this feature in 1.14.0 remains limited.

In addition, 1.15.0 cleans up some of Gomega's internals.  Most users shouldn't notice any differences stemming from the refactoring that was made.

## 1.14.0

### Features
- gmeasure.SamplingConfig now suppers a MinSamplingInterval [e94dbca]
- Eventually and Consistently support functions that make assertions [2f04e6e]
    - Eventually and Consistently now allow their passed-in functions to make assertions.
    These assertions must pass or the function is considered to have failed and is retried.
    - Eventually and Consistently can now take functions with no return values.  These implicitly return nil
    if they contain no failed assertion.  Otherwise they return an error wrapping the first assertion failure.  This allows
    these functions to be used with the Succeed() matcher.
    - Introduce InterceptGomegaFailure - an analogue to InterceptGomegaFailures - that captures the first assertion failure
    and halts execution in its passed-in callback.

## 1.3.0

Improvements:

- The `Equal` matcher matches byte slices more performantly.
- Improved how `MatchError` matches error strings.
- `MatchXML` ignores the order of xml node attributes.
- Improve support for XUnit style golang tests. ([#254](https://github.com/onsi/gomega/issues/254))

Bug Fixes:

- Diff generation now handles multi-byte sequences correctly.
- Multiple goroutines can now call `gexec.Build` concurrently.

## 1.2.0

Improvements:

- Added `BeSent` which attempts to send a value down a channel and fails if the attempt blocks.  Can be paired with `Eventually` to safely send a value down a channel with a timeout.
- `Ω`, `Expect`, `Eventually`, and `Consistently` now immediately `panic` if there is no registered fail handler.  This is always a mistake that can hide failing tests.
- `Receive()` no longer errors when passed a closed channel, it's perfectly fine to attempt to read from a closed channel so Ω(c).Should(Receive()) always fails and Ω(c).ShoudlNot(Receive()) always passes with a closed channel.
- Added `HavePrefix` and `HaveSuffix` matchers.
- `ghttp` can now handle concurrent requests.
- Added `Succeed` which allows one to write `Ω(MyFunction()).Should(Succeed())`.
- Improved `ghttp`'s behavior around failing assertions and panics:
    - If a registered handler makes a failing assertion `ghttp` will return `500`.
    - If a registered handler panics, `ghttp` will return `500` *and* fail the test.  This is new behavior that may cause existing code to break.  This code is almost certainly incorrect and creating a false positive.
- `ghttp` servers can take an `io.Writer`.  `ghttp` will write a line to the writer when each request arrives.
- Added `WithTransform` matcher to allow munging input data before feeding into the relevant matcher
- Added boolean `And`, `Or`, and `Not` matchers to allow creating composite matchers
- Added `gbytes.TimeoutCloser`, `gbytes.TimeoutReader`, and `gbytes.TimeoutWriter` - these are convenience wrappers that timeout if the underlying Closer/Reader/Writer does not return within the alloted time.
- Added `gbytes.BufferReader` - this constructs a `gbytes.Buffer` that asynchronously reads the passed-in `io.Reader` into its buffer.

Bug Fixes:
- gexec: `session.Wait` now uses `EventuallyWithOffset` to get the right line number in the failure.
- `ContainElement` no longer bails if a passed-in matcher errors.

## 1.0 (8/2/2014)

No changes. Dropping "beta" from the version number.

## 1.0.0-beta (7/8/2014)
Breaking Changes:

- Changed OmegaMatcher interface.  Instead of having `Match` return failure messages, two new methods `FailureMessage` and `NegatedFailureMessage` are called instead.
- Moved and renamed OmegaFailHandler to types.GomegaFailHandler and OmegaMatcher to types.GomegaMatcher.  Any references to OmegaMatcher in any custom matchers will need to be changed to point to types.GomegaMatcher

New Test-Support Features:

- `ghttp`: supports testing http clients
    - Provides a flexible fake http server
    - Provides a collection of chainable http handlers that perform assertions.
- `gbytes`: supports making ordered assertions against streams of data
    - Provides a `gbytes.Buffer`
    - Provides a `Say` matcher to perform ordered assertions against output data
- `gexec`: supports testing external processes
    - Provides support for building Go binaries
    - Wraps and starts `exec.Cmd` commands
    - Makes it easy to assert against stdout and stderr
    - Makes it easy to send signals and wait for processes to exit
    - Provides an `Exit` matcher to assert against exit code.

DSL Changes:

- `Eventually` and `Consistently` can accept `time.Duration` interval and polling inputs.
- The default timeouts for `Eventually` and `Consistently` are now configurable.

New Matchers:

- `ConsistOf`: order-independent assertion against the elements of an array/slice or keys of a map.
- `BeTemporally`: like `BeNumerically` but for `time.Time`
- `HaveKeyWithValue`: asserts a map has a given key with the given value.

Updated Matchers:

- `Receive` matcher can take a matcher as an argument and passes only if the channel under test receives an objet that satisfies the passed-in matcher.
- Matchers that implement `MatchMayChangeInTheFuture(actual interface{}) bool` can inform `Eventually` and/or `Consistently` when a match has no chance of changing status in the future.  For example, `Receive` returns `false` when a channel is closed.

Misc:

- Start using semantic versioning
- Start maintaining changelog

Major refactor:

- Pull out Gomega's internal to `internal`
