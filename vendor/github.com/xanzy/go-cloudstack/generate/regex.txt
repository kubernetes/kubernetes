Below are some search/replace regex values (within single quotes)
used within Sublime to format the API docs from the website.

Maybe I'll add another function for this later on, but for now
this also works fine...


Search: '<div.*\n<h5>(.*)</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>'
Replace: '$1'

Search: '<a.*>(.*)</a>\n</li>\n<li>'
Replace: '   $1'

Search: '<a.*>(.*)</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>'
Replace: '   $1'

Search: '</div>\n.*\n'
Replace: ''

Search: '^([\S]+)$'
Replace: '},\n"$1Service": {'

# Watch out with this one, should do this one manually
Search: '^([\S]+)\ ([\S]+)$'
Replace: '},\n"$1$2Service": {'

Search: ' \(A\)$'
Replace: ''

Search: '^   ([\S]+)$'
Replace: '   "$1",'
