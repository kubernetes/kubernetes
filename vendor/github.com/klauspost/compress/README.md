# compress

This package provides various compression algorithms.

* [zstandard](https://github.com/klauspost/compress/tree/master/zstd#zstd) compression and decompression in pure Go.
* [S2](https://github.com/klauspost/compress/tree/master/s2#s2-compression) is a high performance replacement for Snappy.
* Optimized [deflate](https://godoc.org/github.com/klauspost/compress/flate) packages which can be used as a dropin replacement for [gzip](https://godoc.org/github.com/klauspost/compress/gzip), [zip](https://godoc.org/github.com/klauspost/compress/zip) and [zlib](https://godoc.org/github.com/klauspost/compress/zlib).
* [snappy](https://github.com/klauspost/compress/tree/master/snappy) is a drop-in replacement for `github.com/golang/snappy` offering better compression and concurrent streams.
* [huff0](https://github.com/klauspost/compress/tree/master/huff0) and [FSE](https://github.com/klauspost/compress/tree/master/fse) implementations for raw entropy encoding.
* [gzhttp](https://github.com/klauspost/compress/tree/master/gzhttp) Provides client and server wrappers for handling gzipped requests efficiently.
* [pgzip](https://github.com/klauspost/pgzip) is a separate package that provides a very fast parallel gzip implementation.

# package usage

Use `go get github.com/klauspost/compress@latest` to add it to your project.

This package will support the current Go version and 2 versions back.

* Use the `nounsafe` tag to disable all use of the "unsafe" package.
* Use the `noasm` tag to disable all assembly across packages.

Both compression and decompression now supports "synchronous" stream operations. This means that whenever "concurrency" is set to 1, they will operate without spawning goroutines.

Stream decompression is now faster on asynchronous, since the goroutine allocation much more effectively splits the workload. On typical streams this will typically use 2 cores fully for decompression. When a stream has finished decoding no goroutines will be left over, so decoders can now safely be pooled and still be garbage collected.

While the release has been extensively tested, it is recommended to testing when upgrading.

# deflate usage

The packages are drop-in replacements for standard libraries. Simply replace the import path to use them:

Typical speed is about 2x of the standard library packages.

* Optimized [deflate](https://godoc.org/github.com/klauspost/compress/flate) packages which can be used as a dropin replacement for [gzip](https://godoc.org/github.com/klauspost/compress/gzip), [zip](https://godoc.org/github.com/klauspost/compress/zip) and [zlib](https://godoc.org/github.com/klauspost/compress/zlib).

You may also be interested in [pgzip](https://github.com/klauspost/pgzip), which is a drop in replacement for gzip, which support multithreaded compression on big files and the optimized [crc32](https://github.com/klauspost/crc32) package used by these packages.

The packages contains the same as the standard library, so you can use the godoc for that: [gzip](http://golang.org/pkg/compress/gzip/), [zip](http://golang.org/pkg/archive/zip/),  [zlib](http://golang.org/pkg/compress/zlib/), [flate](http://golang.org/pkg/compress/flate/).

Currently there is only minor speedup on decompression (mostly CRC32 calculation).

Memory usage is typically 1MB for a Writer. stdlib is in the same range. 
If you expect to have a lot of concurrently allocated Writers consider using 
the stateless compress described below.

For compression performance, see: [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nuNE2nPfuINCZJRMt6wFWhKpToF95I47XjSsc-1rbPQ/edit?usp=sharing).

To disable all assembly add `-tags=noasm`. This works across all packages.

# Stateless compression

This package offers stateless compression as a special option for gzip/deflate. 
It will do compression but without maintaining any state between Write calls.

This means there will be no memory kept between Write calls, but compression and speed will be suboptimal.

This is only relevant in cases where you expect to run many thousands of compressors concurrently, 
but with very little activity. This is *not* intended for regular web servers serving individual requests.  

Because of this, the size of actual Write calls will affect output size.

In gzip, specify level `-3` / `gzip.StatelessCompression` to enable.

For direct deflate use, NewStatelessWriter and StatelessDeflate are available. See [documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/klauspost/compress/flate#NewStatelessWriter)

A `bufio.Writer` can of course be used to control write sizes. For example, to use a 4KB buffer:

```go
	// replace 'ioutil.Discard' with your output.
	gzw, err := gzip.NewWriterLevel(ioutil.Discard, gzip.StatelessCompression)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer gzw.Close()

	w := bufio.NewWriterSize(gzw, 4096)
	defer w.Flush()
	
	// Write to 'w' 
```

This will only use up to 4KB in memory when the writer is idle. 

Compression is almost always worse than the fastest compression level 
and each write will allocate (a little) memory.
