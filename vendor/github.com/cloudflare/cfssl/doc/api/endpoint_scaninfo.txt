THE SCANINFO ENDPOINT

Endpoint: /api/v1/cfssl/scaninfo
Method:   GET

Result:

    The returned result is a JSON object with keys for each scan family. For
    each family, there exists a `description` containing a string describing the
    family and a `scanners` object mapping each of the family's scanners to
    an object containing a `description` string.

Example:

    $ curl -d '{"label": "primary"}' \
          ${CFSSL_HOST}/api/v1/cfssl/sign  \
          | python -m json.tool
