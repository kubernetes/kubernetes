    "AssumeRole": "<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) that you can use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> for cross-account access or federation. </p> <p><b>Important:</b> You cannot call <code>AssumeRole</code> by using AWS account credentials; access will be denied. You must use IAM user credentials or temporary security credentials to call <code>AssumeRole</code>. </p> <p>For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account and then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html\">IAM Roles (Delegation and Federation)</a> in the <i>Using IAM</i>. </p> <p>For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and authentication system in your corporate network, you don't have to recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been authenticated, you call <code>AssumeRole</code> (and specify the role with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials for that user. With those temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL that users can use to access the console. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html#sts-introduction\">Common Scenarios for Temporary Credentials</a> in the <i>Using IAM</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that you specified when calling <code>AssumeRole</code>, which can be from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1 hour. </p> <p>Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you choose not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access policy of the role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this operation, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being assumed, <i><b>and</b></i> the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed.

The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. You must also have a policy that allows you to call <code>sts:AssumeRole</code>. </p> <p> <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b> </p> <p>You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios in which you want to make sure that the user who is assuming the role has been authenticated using an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication; if the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>Using IAM</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA devices produces. </p> <member name=\"RoleArn\" target=\"arnType\"></member> <member name=\"RoleSessionName\" target=\"userNameType\"></member> <member name=\"Policy\" target=\"sessionPolicyDocumentType\"></member> <member name=\"DurationSeconds\" target=\"roleDurationSecondsType\"></member> <member name=\"ExternalId\" target=\"externalIdType\"></member>",

Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the application, and without deploying server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. </p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token.

    "DecodeAuthorizationMessage": "<p>Decodes additional information about the authorization status of a request from an encoded message returned in response to an AWS request. </p> <p>For example, if a user is not authorized to perform an action that he or she has requested, the request returns a <code>Client.UnauthorizedOperation</code> response (an HTTP 403 response). Some AWS actions additionally return an encoded message that can provide details about this authorization failure. </p> <note> Only certain AWS actions return an encoded authorization message. The documentation for an individual action indicates whether that action returns an encoded message in addition to returning an HTTP code. </note> <p>The message is encoded because the details of the authorization status can constitute privileged information that the user who requested the action should not see. To decode an authorization status message, a user must be granted permissions via an IAM policy to request the <code>DecodeAuthorizationMessage</code> (<code>sts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage</code>) action. </p> <p>The decoded message includes the following type of information: </p> <ul> <li>Whether the request was denied due to an explicit deny or due to the absence of an explicit allow.

    "GetFederationToken": "<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network. Because you must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> action using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually in a server-based application.</p> <note> <p> If you are creating a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider, we recommend that you use <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\">Amazon Cognito</a> or <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity\">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a>.</p> </note> <p>The <code>GetFederationToken</code> action must be called by using the long-term AWS security credentials of an IAM user. You can also call <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security credentials of an AWS account (root), but this is not recommended. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application and then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources they need access to. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html\">IAM Best Practices</a> in the <i>Using IAM</i>. </p> <p>The temporary security credentials that are obtained by using the long-term credentials of an IAM user are valid for the specified duration, between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 129600 seconds (36 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using AWS account (root) credentials have a maximum duration of 3600 seconds (1 hour)</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The permissions for the temporary security credentials returned by <code>GetFederationToken</code> are determined by a combination of the following: </p> <ul> <li>The policy or policies that are attached to the IAM user whose credentials are used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code>.</li> <li>The policy that is passed as a parameter in the call.</li> </ul> <p>The passed policy is attached to the temporary security credentials that result from the <code>GetFederationToken</code> API call--that is, to the <i>federated user</i>. When the federated user makes an AWS request, AWS evaluates the policy attached to the federated user in combination with the policy or policies attached to the IAM user whose credentials were used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code>. AWS allows the federated user's request only when both the federated user <i><b>and</b></i> the IAM user are explicitly allowed to perform the requested action. The passed policy cannot grant more permissions than those that are defined in the IAM user policy.</p> <p>A typical use case is that the permissions of the IAM user whose credentials are used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code> are designed to allow access to all the actions and resources that any federated user will need. Then, for individual users, you pass a policy to the operation that scopes down the permissions to a level that's appropriate to that individual user, using a policy that allows only a subset of permissions that are granted to the IAM user. </p> <p>If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security credentials have no effective permissions. The only exception is when the temporary security credentials are used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy that specifically allows the federated user to access the resource. </p> <p>For more information about how permissions work, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_getfederationtoken.html\">Permissions for GetFederationToken</a>.
