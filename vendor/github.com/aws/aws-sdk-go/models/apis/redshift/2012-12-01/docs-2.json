  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Redshift</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management interfaces, go to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html\">Using the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces</a>.</p> <p>Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers.</p> <p>If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html\">Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide</a>.</p> <p>If you are a database developer, the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html\">Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide</a> explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse. </p>",

You can add as many as 20 ingress rules to an Amazon Redshift security group.</p> <p>If you authorize access to an Amazon EC2 security group, specify <i>EC2SecurityGroupName</i> and <i>EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId</i>. The Amazon EC2 security group and Amazon Redshift cluster must be in the same AWS region. </p> <p>If you authorize access to a CIDR/IP address range, specify <i>CIDRIP</i>.

By default, Amazon Redshift creates the resulting cluster with the same configuration as the original cluster from which the snapshot was created, except that the new cluster is created with the default cluster security and parameter groups. After Amazon Redshift creates the cluster, you can use the <a>ModifyCluster</a> API to associate a different security group and different parameter group with the restored cluster. If you are using a DS node type, you can also choose to change to another DS node type of the same size during restore.</p> <p>If you restore a cluster into a VPC, you must provide a cluster subnet group where you want the cluster restored.</p> <p> For more information about working with snapshots, go to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-snapshots.html\">Amazon Redshift Snapshots</a> in the <i>Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide</i>.</p>",
    "RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot": "<p>Creates a new table from a table in an Amazon Redshift cluster snapshot. You must create the new table within the Amazon Redshift cluster that the snapshot was taken from.</p> <p>You cannot use <code>RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot</code> to restore a table with the same name as an existing table in an Amazon Redshift cluster. That is, you cannot overwrite an existing table in a cluster with a restored table. If you want to replace your original table with a new, restored table, then rename or drop your original table before you call <code>RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot</code>. When you have renamed your original table, then you can pass the original name of the table as the <code>NewTableName</code> parameter value in the call to <code>RestoreTableFromClusterSnapshot</code>. This way, you can replace the original table with the table created from the snapshot.</p>",
