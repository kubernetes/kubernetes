  "service": "<p>AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS Batch will be familiar to users of traditional batch computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in order to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results quickly.</p> <p>As a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install or manage batch computing software, which allows you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch reduces operational complexities, saves time, and reduces costs, which makes it easy for developers, scientists, and engineers to run their batch jobs in the AWS Cloud.</p>",

Instances launched into a managed compute environment use a recent, approved version of the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI. You can choose to use Amazon EC2 On-Demand instances in your managed compute environment, or you can use Amazon EC2 Spot instances that only launch when the Spot bid price is below a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.</p> <p>In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own compute resources. This provides more compute resource configuration options, such as using a custom AMI, but you must ensure that your AMI meets the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html\">Container Instance AMIs</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide</i>. After you have created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the <a>DescribeComputeEnvironments</a> operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that is associated with it and then manually launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster.
