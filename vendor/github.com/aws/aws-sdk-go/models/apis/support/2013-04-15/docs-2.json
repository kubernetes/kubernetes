  "service": "<fullname>AWS Support</fullname> <p>The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.</p> <p>The AWS Support service also exposes a set of <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/\">Trusted Advisor</a> features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks. </p> <p>The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels. </b>The <a>DescribeServices</a> and <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a> operations return AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the <a>CreateCase</a> operation. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Case creation, case details, and case resolution.</b> The <a>CreateCase</a>, <a>DescribeCases</a>, <a>DescribeAttachment</a>, and <a>ResolveCase</a> operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Case communication.</b> The <a>DescribeCommunications</a>, <a>AddCommunicationToCase</a>, and <a>AddAttachmentsToSet</a> operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases. </p> </li> </ul> <p>The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks</a> returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using the <code>checkId</code> for a specific check returned by <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks</a>, you can call <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult</a> to obtain the results for the check you specified.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries</a> returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck</a> requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses</a> reports the refresh status of one or more checks. </p> </li> </ul> <p>For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>.</p> <p>See <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html\">About the AWS Support API</a> in the <i>AWS Support User Guide</i> for information about how to use this service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources. </p>",

If an <code>attachmentSetId</code> is not specified, a new attachment set is created, and the ID of the set is returned in the response. If an <code>attachmentSetId</code> is specified, the attachments are added to the specified set, if it exists.</p> <p>An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that are to be added to a case or case communication. The set is available for one hour after it is created; the <code>expiryTime</code> returned in the response indicates when the set expires. The maximum number of attachments in a set is 3, and the maximum size of any attachment in the set is 5 MB.</p>",
    "AddCommunicationToCase": "<p>Adds additional customer communication to an AWS Support case. You use the <code>caseId</code> value to identify the case to add communication to. You can list a set of email addresses to copy on the communication using the <code>ccEmailAddresses</code> value. The <code>communicationBody</code> value contains the text of the communication.</p> <p>The response indicates the success or failure of the request.</p> <p>This operation implements a subset of the features of the AWS Support Center.</p>",
    "CreateCase": "<p>Creates a new case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is modeled on the behavior of the AWS Support Center <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create\">Create Case</a> page. Its parameters require you to specify the following information: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>issueType.</b> The type of issue for the case. You can specify either \"customer-service\" or \"technical.\" If you do not indicate a value, the default is \"technical.\" </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>serviceCode.</b> The code for an AWS service.

You also obtain the category code for a service by calling <a>DescribeServices</a>. Each AWS service defines its own set of category codes. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>severityCode.</b> A value that indicates the urgency of the case, which in turn determines the response time according to your service level agreement with AWS Support. You obtain the SeverityCode by calling <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>subject.</b> The <b>Subject</b> field on the AWS Support Center <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create\">Create Case</a> page.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>communicationBody.</b> The <b>Description</b> field on the AWS Support Center <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create\">Create Case</a> page.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>attachmentSetId.</b> The ID of a set of attachments that has been created by using <a>AddAttachmentsToSet</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>language.</b> The human language in which AWS Support handles the case.

Case numbers are used by the <a>DescribeCases</a> operation to retrieve existing AWS Support cases. </p>",
    "DescribeAttachment": "<p>Returns the attachment that has the specified ID. Attachment IDs are generated by the case management system when you add an attachment to a case or case communication.

    "DescribeCases": "<p>Returns a list of cases that you specify by passing one or more case IDs. In addition, you can filter the cases by date by setting values for the <code>afterTime</code> and <code>beforeTime</code> request parameters.

If a case was created more than 12 months ago, a request for data might cause an error.</p> <p>You can use the <code>maxResults</code> and <code>nextToken</code> parameters to control the pagination of the result set. Set <code>maxResults</code> to the number of cases you want displayed on each page, and use <code>nextToken</code> to specify the resumption of pagination.</p>",
    "DescribeServices": "<p>Returns the current list of AWS services and a list of service categories that applies to each one. You then use service names and categories in your <a>CreateCase</a> requests.

The values in those fields, however, do not necessarily match the service codes and categories returned by the <code>DescribeServices</code> request. Always use the service codes and categories obtained programmatically. This practice ensures that you always have the most recent set of service and category codes.</p>",
    "DescribeSeverityLevels": "<p>Returns the list of severity levels that you can assign to an AWS Support case. The severity level for a case is also a field in the <a>CaseDetails</a> data type included in any <a>CreateCase</a> request. </p>",

Check IDs can be obtained by calling <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks</a>.</p> <note> <p>Some checks are refreshed automatically, and they cannot be refreshed by using this operation.
