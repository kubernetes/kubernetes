By default, PutDestination does not set any access policy with the destination, which means a cross-account user will not be able to call <code>PutSubscriptionFilter</code> against this destination. To enable that, the destination owner must call <code>PutDestinationPolicy</code> after PutDestination. </p>",
    "PutDestinationPolicy": "<p> Creates or updates an access policy associated with an existing <code>Destination</code>.

    "PutRetentionPolicy": "<p> Sets the retention of the specified log group. A retention policy allows you to configure the number of days you want to retain log events in the specified log group. </p>",
    "PutSubscriptionFilter": "<p> Creates or updates a subscription filter and associates it with the specified log group. Subscription filters allow you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log events ingested through <code class=\"code\">PutLogEvents</code> requests and have them delivered to a specific destination. Currently, the supported destinations are: <ul> <li> A Amazon Kinesis stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery. </li> <li> A logical destination (used via an ARN of <code>Destination</code>) belonging to a different account, for cross-account delivery. </li> </ul> </p> <p> Currently there can only be one subscription filter associated with a log group. </p>",
