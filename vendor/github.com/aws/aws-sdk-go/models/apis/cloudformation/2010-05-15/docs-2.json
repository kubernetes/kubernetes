  "service": "<fullname>AWS CloudFormation</fullname> <p>AWS CloudFormation allows you to create and manage AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use AWS CloudFormation to leverage AWS products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.</p> <p>With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you.</p> <p>For more information about AWS CloudFormation, see the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation Product Page</a>.</p> <p>Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can find the product's technical documentation at <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/\">docs.aws.amazon.com</a>.</p>",

    "CancelUpdateStack": "<p>Cancels an update on the specified stack. If the call completes successfully, the stack rolls back the update and reverts to the previous stack configuration.</p> <note> <p>You can cancel only stacks that are in the UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS state.</p> </note>",
    "ContinueUpdateRollback": "<p>For a specified stack that is in the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED</code> state, continues rolling it back to the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE</code> state. Depending on the cause of the failure, you can manually <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed\"> fix the error</a> and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can return your stack to a working state (the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE</code> state), and then try to update the stack again.</p> <p>A stack goes into the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED</code> state when AWS CloudFormation cannot roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, you might have a stack that is rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of AWS CloudFormation. Because AWS CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.</p>",
    "CreateChangeSet": "<p>Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set shows all of the resources that AWS CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an existing stack, AWS CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which resources AWS CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack.</p> <p>To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the <code>ChangeSetType</code> parameter, specify <code>CREATE</code>. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify <code>UPDATE</code> for the <code>ChangeSetType</code> parameter. After the <code>CreateChangeSet</code> call successfully completes, AWS CloudFormation starts creating the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the <a>DescribeChangeSet</a> action.</p> <p>When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make, execute the change set by using the <a>ExecuteChangeSet</a> action.

Some stack set templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account—for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stack sets, you must explicitly acknowledge their capabilities by specifying this parameter.</p> <p>The only valid values are CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. The following resources require you to specify this parameter: </p> <ul> <li> <p>AWS::IAM::AccessKey</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS::IAM::Group</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS::IAM::Policy</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS::IAM::Role</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS::IAM::User</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition</p> </li> </ul> <p>If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions that are associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.</p> <p>If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability. If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. If you don't specify this parameter, this action returns an <code>InsufficientCapabilities</code> error.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-template.html#capabilities\">Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates.</a> </p>",
