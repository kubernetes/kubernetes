  "version": "2.0",
  "service": "<p>Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-enabled applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like security groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM roles.</p> <p>You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.</p>",
  "operations": {
    "CreateCluster": "<p>Creates a new Amazon ECS cluster. By default, your account receives a <code>default</code> cluster when you launch your first container instance. However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the <code>CreateCluster</code> action.</p>",
    "CreateService": "<p>Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS spawns another instantiation of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see <a>UpdateService</a>.</p> <p>You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. During a deployment (which is triggered by changing the task definition of a service with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation), the service scheduler uses the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and <code>maximumPercent</code> parameters to determine the deployment strategy.</p> <p>If the <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore the <code>desiredCount</code> temporarily during a deployment. For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks, a <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state; tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance it is hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 50% in the console and 100% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the APIs.</p> <p>The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a <code>desiredCount</code> of four tasks, a <code>maximumPercent</code> value of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for <code>maximumPercent</code> is 200%.</p> <p>When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it attempts to balance them across the Availability Zones in your cluster with the following logic:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).</p> </li> <li> <p>Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.</p> </li> </ul>",

If the service is actively maintaining tasks, you cannot delete it, and you must update the service to a desired task count of zero. For more information, see <a>UpdateService</a>.</p> <note> <p>When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service status moves from <code>ACTIVE</code> to <code>DRAINING</code>, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in <a>ListServices</a> API operations. After the tasks have stopped, then the service status moves from <code>DRAINING</code> to <code>INACTIVE</code>. Services in the <code>DRAINING</code> or <code>INACTIVE</code> status can still be viewed with <a>DescribeServices</a> API operations; however, in the future, <code>INACTIVE</code> services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record keeping, and <a>DescribeServices</a> API operations on those services will return a <code>ServiceNotFoundException</code> error.</p> </note>",

This instance is no longer available to run tasks.</p> <p>If you intend to use the container instance for some other purpose after deregistration, you should stop all of the tasks running on the container instance before deregistration to avoid any orphaned tasks from consuming resources.</p> <p>Deregistering a container instance removes the instance from a cluster, but it does not terminate the EC2 instance; if you are finished using the instance, be sure to terminate it in the Amazon EC2 console to stop billing.</p> <note><p>When you terminate a container instance, it is automatically deregistered from your cluster.</p></note>",

However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units.</p> <p>The Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers.

The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2; however, the CPU parameter is not required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:</p> <ul> <li><b>Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:</b> Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to 2 CPU shares.</li> <li><b>Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0:</b> Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.</li></ul>",
