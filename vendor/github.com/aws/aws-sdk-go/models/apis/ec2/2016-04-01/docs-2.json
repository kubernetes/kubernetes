After you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block. The subnet's CIDR block can be the same as the VPC's CIDR block (assuming you want only a single subnet in the VPC), or a subset of the VPC's CIDR block. If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the subnets' CIDR blocks must not overlap. The smallest subnet (and VPC) you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IP addresses), and the largest uses a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses).</p> <important> <p>AWS reserves both the first four and the last IP address in each subnet's CIDR block. They're not available for use.</p> </important> <p>If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a logical router in the middle.</p> <p>If you launch an instance in a VPC using an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, the IP address doesn't change if you stop and restart the instance (unlike a similar instance launched outside a VPC, which gets a new IP address when restarted). It's therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they're all stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available.</p> <p>For more information about subnets, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html\">Your VPC and Subnets</a> in the <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>",

Creating an AMI from an EBS snapshot does not maintain this billing code, and subsequent instances launched from such an AMI will not be able to connect to package update infrastructure.</p> <p>Similarly, although you can create a Windows AMI from a snapshot, you can't successfully launch an instance from the AMI.</p> <p>To create Windows AMIs or to create AMIs for Linux operating systems that must retain AMI billing codes to work properly, see <a>CreateImage</a>.</p> </important> <p>If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time.
