  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Simple Notification Service</fullname> <p>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/sns/\">http://aws.amazon.com/sns</a>. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/\">Amazon SNS Developer Guide</a>. </p> <p>We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>. </p>",

    "CreatePlatformEndpoint": "<p>Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services, such as GCM and APNS. <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> requires the PlatformApplicationArn that is returned from <code>CreatePlatformApplication</code>. The EndpointArn that is returned when using <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> can then be used by the <code>Publish</code> action to send a message to a mobile app or by the <code>Subscribe</code> action for subscription to a topic. The <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns an endpoint with the same device token and attributes, that endpoint's ARN is returned without creating a new endpoint. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePush.html\">Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications</a>. </p> <p>When using <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> with Baidu, two attributes must be provided: ChannelId and UserId.

When Amazon SNS determines that sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds this limit, it stops sending SMS messages within minutes.</p> <important> <p>Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit being crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS messages, you will incur costs that exceed your limit.</p> </important> <p>By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by Amazon SNS. If you want to exceed the maximum, contact <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/\">AWS Support</a> or your AWS sales representative for a service limit increase.</p> <p> <code>DeliveryStatusIAMRole</code> – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other information.</p> <p> <code>DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate</code> – The percentage of successful SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs. The value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example, to write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to <code>0</code>. To write logs for 10% of your successful deliveries, set it to <code>10</code>.</p> <p> <code>DefaultSenderID</code> – A string, such as your business brand, that is displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric characters, and it must contain at least one letter.</p> <p> <code>DefaultSMSType</code> – The type of SMS message that you will send by default. You can assign the following values:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Promotional</code> – (Default) Noncritical messages, such as marketing messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the lowest cost.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Transactional</code> – Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to achieve the highest reliability.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <code>UsageReportS3Bucket</code> – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report includes the following information for each SMS message that was successfully delivered by your account:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Time that the message was published (in UTC)</p> </li> <li> <p>Message ID</p> </li> <li> <p>Destination phone number</p> </li> <li> <p>Message type</p> </li> <li> <p>Delivery status</p> </li> <li> <p>Message price (in USD)</p> </li> <li> <p>Part number (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too long for a single message)</p> </li> <li> <p>Total number of parts</p> </li> </ul> <p>To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the Amazon SNS service principle to perform the <code>s3:PutObject</code> and <code>s3:GetBucketLocation</code> actions.</p> <p>For an example bucket policy and usage report, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sms_stats.html\">Monitoring SMS Activity</a> in the <i>Amazon SNS Developer Guide</i>.</p>"
