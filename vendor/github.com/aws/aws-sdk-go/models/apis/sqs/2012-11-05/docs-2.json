    "AddPermission": "<p>Adds a permission to a queue for a specific <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#P\">principal</a>. This allows for sharing access to the queue.</p> <p>When you create a queue, you have full control access rights for the queue. Only you (as owner of the queue) can grant or deny permissions to the queue. For more information about these permissions, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/acp-overview.html\">Shared Queues</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p><code>AddPermission</code> writes an Amazon SQS-generated policy. If you want to write your own policy, use <a>SetQueueAttributes</a> to upload your policy. For more information about writing your own policy, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AccessPolicyLanguage.html\">Using The Access Policy Language</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note> <note>Some API actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the <code>param.n</code> notation. Values of <code>n</code> are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this: </note> <p><code>&amp;Attribute.1=this</code></p> <p><code>&amp;Attribute.2=that</code></p>",
    "ChangeMessageVisibility": "<p>Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The maximum allowed timeout value you can set the value to is 12 hours. This means you can't extend the timeout of a message in an existing queue to more than a total visibility timeout of 12 hours. (For more information visibility timeout, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html\">Visibility Timeout</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.)</p> <p>For example, let's say you have a message and its default message visibility timeout is 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call <code>ChangeMessageVisiblity</code> with a timeout of 10 minutes. At that time, the timeout for the message would be extended by 10 minutes beyond the time of the ChangeMessageVisibility call. This results in a total visibility timeout of 13 minutes. You can continue to call ChangeMessageVisibility to extend the visibility timeout to a maximum of 12 hours. If you try to extend beyond 12 hours, the request will be rejected.</p> <note><p>There is a 120,000 limit for the number of inflight messages per queue. Messages are inflight after they have been received from the queue by a consuming component, but have not yet been deleted from the queue. If you reach the 120,000 limit, you will receive an OverLimit error message from Amazon SQS. To help avoid reaching the limit, you should delete the messages from the queue after they have been processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process the messages. </p></note> <important>If you attempt to set the <code>VisibilityTimeout</code> to an amount more than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. It will not automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum time remaining.</important> <important>Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message, that timeout value is applied immediately but is not saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message the next time it is received reverts to the original timeout value, not the value you set with the <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> action.</important>",
    "ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch": "<p>Changes the visibility timeout of multiple messages. This is a batch version of <a>ChangeMessageVisibility</a>. The result of the action on each message is reported individually in the response. You can send up to 10 <a>ChangeMessageVisibility</a> requests with each <code>ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch</code> action.</p> <important>Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of 200.</important> <note>Some API actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the <code>param.n</code> notation. Values of <code>n</code> are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this: </note> <p><code>&amp;Attribute.1=this</code></p> <p><code>&amp;Attribute.2=that</code></p>",
    "CreateQueue": "<p>Creates a new queue, or returns the URL of an existing one. When you request <code>CreateQueue</code>, you provide a name for the queue. To successfully create a new queue, you must provide a name that is unique within the scope of your own queues.</p> <note> <p>If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name.</p> </note> <p>You may pass one or more attributes in the request. If you do not provide a value for any attribute, the queue will have the default value for that attribute. Permitted attributes are the same that can be set using <a>SetQueueAttributes</a>.</p> <note><p>Use <a>GetQueueUrl</a> to get a queue's URL. <a>GetQueueUrl</a> requires only the <code>QueueName</code> parameter.</p></note> <p>If you provide the name of an existing queue, along with the exact names and values of all the queue's attributes, <code>CreateQueue</code> returns the queue URL for the existing queue. If the queue name, attribute names, or attribute values do not match an existing queue, <code>CreateQueue</code> returns an error.</p> <note>Some API actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the <code>param.n</code> notation. Values of <code>n</code> are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this: </note> <p><code>&amp;Attribute.1=this</code></p> <p><code>&amp;Attribute.2=that</code></p>",
    "DeleteMessage": "<p> Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. You specify the message by using the message's <code>receipt handle</code> and not the <code>message ID</code> you received when you sent the message. Even if the message is locked by another reader due to the visibility timeout setting, it is still deleted from the queue. If you leave a message in the queue for longer than the queue's configured retention period, Amazon SQS automatically deletes it. </p> <note> <p> The receipt handle is associated with a specific instance of receiving the message. If you receive a message more than once, the receipt handle you get each time you receive the message is different. When you request <code>DeleteMessage</code>, if you don't provide the most recently received receipt handle for the message, the request will still succeed, but the message might not be deleted. </p> </note> <important> <p> It is possible you will receive a message even after you have deleted it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers storing a copy of the message is unavailable when you request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you again on a subsequent receive request. You should create your system to be idempotent so that receiving a particular message more than once is not a problem. </p> </important>",
    "DeleteMessageBatch": "<p>Deletes up to ten messages from the specified queue. This is a batch version of <a>DeleteMessage</a>. The result of the delete action on each message is reported individually in the response.</p> <important> <p> Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of 200. </p> </important> <note>Some API actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the <code>param.n</code> notation. Values of <code>n</code> are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this: </note> <p><code>&amp;Attribute.1=this</code></p> <p><code>&amp;Attribute.2=that</code></p>",
    "DeleteQueue": "<p> Deletes the queue specified by the <b>queue URL</b>, regardless of whether the queue is empty. If the specified queue does not exist, Amazon SQS returns a successful response. </p> <important> <p> Use <code>DeleteQueue</code> with care; once you delete your queue, any messages in the queue are no longer available. </p> </important> <p> When you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. Requests you send involving that queue during the 60 seconds might succeed. For example, a <a>SendMessage</a> request might succeed, but after the 60 seconds, the queue and that message you sent no longer exist. Also, when you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name. </p> <p> We reserve the right to delete queues that have had no activity for more than 30 days.

    "GetQueueUrl": "<p> Returns the URL of an existing queue. This action provides a simple way to retrieve the URL of an Amazon SQS queue. </p> <p> To access a queue that belongs to another AWS account, use the <code>QueueOwnerAWSAccountId</code> parameter to specify the account ID of the queue's owner.

    "PurgeQueue": "<p>Deletes the messages in a queue specified by the <b>queue URL</b>.</p> <important>When you use the <code>PurgeQueue</code> API, the deleted messages in the queue cannot be retrieved.</important> <p>When you purge a queue, the message deletion process takes up to 60 seconds. All messages sent to the queue before calling <code>PurgeQueue</code> will be deleted; messages sent to the queue while it is being purged may be deleted. While the queue is being purged, messages sent to the queue before <code>PurgeQueue</code> was called may be received, but will be deleted within the next minute.</p>",
    "ReceiveMessage": "<p> Retrieves one or more messages, with a maximum limit of 10 messages, from the specified queue.

This means only the messages on the sampled machines are returned. If the number of messages in the queue is small (less than 1000), it is likely you will get fewer messages than you requested per <code>ReceiveMessage</code> call. If the number of messages in the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a particular <code>ReceiveMessage</code> response; in which case you should repeat the request. </p> <p> For each message returned, the response includes the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p> Message body </p> </li> <li> <p> MD5 digest of the message body.
