    "BatchGetItem": "<p>The <i>BatchGetItem</i> operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key.</p> <p>A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. <i>BatchGetItem</i> will return a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for <i>UnprocessedKeys</i>. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get.</p> <important><p>If you request more than 100 items <i>BatchGetItem</i> will return a <i>ValidationException</i> with the message \"Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call\".</p></important> <p>For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate <i>UnprocessedKeys</i> value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one data set.</p> <p>If <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then <i>BatchGetItem</i> will return a <i>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</i>. If <i>at least one</i> of the items is successfully processed, then <i>BatchGetItem</i> completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in <i>UnprocessedKeys</i>.</p> <important> <p>If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, <i>we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm</i>. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#BatchOperations\">Batch Operations and Error Handling</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> </important> <p>By default, <i>BatchGetItem</i> performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set <i>ConsistentRead</i> to <code>true</code> for any or all tables.</p> <p>In order to minimize response latency, <i>BatchGetItem</i> retrieves items in parallel.</p> <p>When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return attributes in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the <i>AttributesToGet</i> parameter.</p> <p>If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html#CapacityUnitCalculations\">Capacity Units Calculations</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p>",
    "BatchWriteItem": "<p>The <i>BatchWriteItem</i> operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to <i>BatchWriteItem</i> can write up to 16 MB of data, which can comprise as many as 25 put or delete requests. Individual items to be written can be as large as 400 KB.</p> <note> <p><i>BatchWriteItem</i> cannot update items. To update items, use the <i>UpdateItem</i> API.</p> </note> <p>The individual <i>PutItem</i> and <i>DeleteItem</i> operations specified in <i>BatchWriteItem</i> are atomic; however <i>BatchWriteItem</i> as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the <i>UnprocessedItems</i> response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call <i>BatchWriteItem</i> in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new <i>BatchWriteItem</i> request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.</p> <p>Note that if <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then <i>BatchWriteItem</i> will return a <i>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</i>.</p> <important> <p>If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, <i>we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm</i>. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables.

In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, <i>BatchWriteItem</i> does not behave in the same way as individual <i>PutItem</i> and <i>DeleteItem</i> calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and <i>BatchWriteItem</i> does not return deleted items in the response.</p> <p>If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, <i>BatchWriteItem</i> provides an alternative where the API performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application.</p> <p>Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit.</p> <p>If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>One or more tables specified in the <i>BatchWriteItem</i> request does not exist.</p> </li> <li> <p>Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.</p> </li> <li> <p>You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same <i>BatchWriteItem</i> request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same <i>BatchWriteItem</i> request. </p> </li> <li> <p>There are more than 25 requests in the batch.</p> </li> <li> <p>Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.</p> </li> <li> <p>The total request size exceeds 16 MB.</p> </li> </ul>",
    "CreateTable": "<p>The <i>CreateTable</i> operation adds a new table to your account. In an AWS account, table names must be unique within each region. That is, you can have two tables with same name if you create the tables in different regions.</p> <p><i>CreateTable</i> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <i>CreateTable</i> request, DynamoDB immediately returns a response with a <i>TableStatus</i> of <code>CREATING</code>. After the table is created, DynamoDB sets the <i>TableStatus</i> to <code>ACTIVE</code>. You can perform read and write operations only on an <code>ACTIVE</code> table. </p> <p>You can optionally define secondary indexes on the new table, as part of the <i>CreateTable</i> operation. If you want to create multiple tables with secondary indexes on them, you must create the tables sequentially. Only one table with secondary indexes can be in the <code>CREATING</code> state at any given time.</p> <p>You can use the <i>DescribeTable</i> API to check the table status.</p>",
    "DeleteItem": "<p>Deletes a single item in a table by primary key. You can perform a conditional delete operation that deletes the item if it exists, or if it has an expected attribute value.</p> <p>In addition to deleting an item, you can also return the item's attribute values in the same operation, using the <i>ReturnValues</i> parameter.</p> <p>Unless you specify conditions, the <i>DeleteItem</i> is an idempotent operation; running it multiple times on the same item or attribute does <i>not</i> result in an error response.</p> <p>Conditional deletes are useful for deleting items only if specific conditions are met. If those conditions are met, DynamoDB performs the delete. Otherwise, the item is not deleted. </p>",
    "DeleteTable": "<p>The <i>DeleteTable</i> operation deletes a table and all of its items. After a <i>DeleteTable</i> request, the specified table is in the <code>DELETING</code> state until DynamoDB completes the deletion. If the table is in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state, you can delete it. If a table is in <code>CREATING</code> or <code>UPDATING</code> states, then DynamoDB returns a <i>ResourceInUseException</i>. If the specified table does not exist, DynamoDB returns a <i>ResourceNotFoundException</i>. If table is already in the <code>DELETING</code> state, no error is returned. </p> <note> <p>DynamoDB might continue to accept data read and write operations, such as <i>GetItem</i> and <i>PutItem</i>, on a table in the <code>DELETING</code> state until the table deletion is complete.</p> </note> <p>When you delete a table, any indexes on that table are also deleted.</p> <p>If you have DynamoDB Streams enabled on the table, then the corresponding stream on that table goes into the <code>DISABLED</code> state, and the stream is automatically deleted after 24 hours.</p> <p>Use the <i>DescribeTable</i> API to check the status of the table. </p>",
    "DescribeTable": "<p>Returns information about the table, including the current status of the table, when it was created, the primary key schema, and any indexes on the table.</p> <note> <p>If you issue a DescribeTable request immediately after a CreateTable request, DynamoDB might return a ResourceNotFoundException. This is because DescribeTable uses an eventually consistent query, and the metadata for your table might not be available at that moment. Wait for a few seconds, and then try the DescribeTable request again.</p> </note>",
    "GetItem": "<p>The <i>GetItem</i> operation returns a set of attributes for the item with the given primary key. If there is no matching item, <i>GetItem</i> does not return any data.</p> <p><i>GetItem</i> provides an eventually consistent read by default. If your application requires a strongly consistent read, set <i>ConsistentRead</i> to <code>true</code>. Although a strongly consistent read might take more time than an eventually consistent read, it always returns the last updated value.</p>",
    "ListTables": "<p>Returns an array of table names associated with the current account and endpoint. The output from <i>ListTables</i> is paginated, with each page returning a maximum of 100 table names.</p>",
    "PutItem": "<p>Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item that has the same primary key as the new item already exists in the specified table, the new item completely replaces the existing item. You can perform a conditional put operation (add a new item if one with the specified primary key doesn't exist), or replace an existing item if it has certain attribute values. </p> <p>In addition to putting an item, you can also return the item's attribute values in the same operation, using the <i>ReturnValues</i> parameter.</p> <p>When you add an item, the primary key attribute(s) are the only required attributes. Attribute values cannot be null. String and Binary type attributes must have lengths greater than zero. Set type attributes cannot be empty. Requests with empty values will be rejected with a <i>ValidationException</i> exception.</p> <p>You can request that <i>PutItem</i> return either a copy of the original item (before the update) or a copy of the updated item (after the update). For more information, see the <i>ReturnValues</i> description below.</p> <note> <p>To prevent a new item from replacing an existing item, use a conditional put operation with <i>ComparisonOperator</i> set to <code>NULL</code> for the primary key attribute, or attributes.</p> </note> <p>For more information about using this API, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html\">Working with Items</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p>",
    "Query": "<p>A <i>Query</i> operation uses the primary key of a table or a secondary index to directly access items from that table or index.</p> <p>Use the <i>KeyConditionExpression</i> parameter to provide a specific hash key value. The <i>Query</i> operation will return all of the items from the table or index with that hash key value.

You can use the <i>ScanIndexForward</i> parameter to get results in forward or reverse order, by range key or by index key. </p> <p>Queries that do not return results consume the minimum number of read capacity units for that type of read operation.</p> <p>If the total number of items meeting the query criteria exceeds the result set size limit of 1 MB, the query stops and results are returned to the user with the <i>LastEvaluatedKey</i> element to continue the query in a subsequent operation. Unlike a <i>Scan</i> operation, a <i>Query</i> operation never returns both an empty result set and a <i>LastEvaluatedKey</i> value. <i>LastEvaluatedKey</i> is only provided if the results exceed 1 MB, or if you have used the <i>Limit</i> parameter. </p> <p>You can query a table, a local secondary index, or a global secondary index. For a query on a table or on a local secondary index, you can set the <i>ConsistentRead</i> parameter to <code>true</code> and obtain a strongly consistent result. Global secondary indexes support eventually consistent reads only, so do not specify <i>ConsistentRead</i> when querying a global secondary index.</p>",
    "Scan": "<p>The <i>Scan</i> operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in a table or a secondary index. To have DynamoDB return fewer items, you can provide a <i>ScanFilter</i> operation.</p> <p>If the total number of scanned items exceeds the maximum data set size limit of 1 MB, the scan stops and results are returned to the user as a <i>LastEvaluatedKey</i> value to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. The results also include the number of items exceeding the limit. A scan can result in no table data meeting the filter criteria. </p> <p>By default, <i>Scan</i> operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on a large table or secondary index, applications can request a parallel <i>Scan</i> operation by providing the <i>Segment</i> and <i>TotalSegments</i> parameters.

    "UpdateItem": "<p> Edits an existing item's attributes, or adds a new item to the table if it does not already exist. You can put, delete, or add attribute values. You can also perform a conditional update on an existing item (insert a new attribute name-value pair if it doesn't exist, or replace an existing name-value pair if it has certain expected attribute values). If conditions are specified and the item does not exist, then the operation fails and a new item is not created. </p> <p>You can also return the item's attribute values in the same <i>UpdateItem</i> operation using the <i>ReturnValues</i> parameter.</p>",
    "UpdateTable": "<p>Modifies the provisioned throughput settings, global secondary indexes, or DynamoDB Streams settings for a given table.</p> <p>You can only perform one of the following operations at once:</p> <ul> <li><p>Modify the provisioned throughput settings of the table.</p></li> <li><p>Enable or disable Streams on the table.</p></li> <li><p>Remove a global secondary index from the table.</p></li> <li> <p>Create a new global secondary index on the table.

  "service": "<fullname>Amazon DynamoDB</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b></p> <p>This is the Amazon DynamoDB API Reference. This guide provides descriptions and samples of the low-level DynamoDB API. For information about DynamoDB application development, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/\">Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>Instead of making the requests to the low-level DynamoDB API directly from your application, we recommend that you use the AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs). The easy-to-use libraries in the AWS SDKs make it unnecessary to call the low-level DynamoDB API directly from your application. The libraries take care of request authentication, serialization, and connection management. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/UsingAWSSDK.html\">Using the AWS SDKs with DynamoDB</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>If you decide to code against the low-level DynamoDB API directly, you will need to write the necessary code to authenticate your requests. For more information on signing your requests, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/API.html\">Using the DynamoDB API</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>The following are short descriptions of each low-level API action, organized by function.</p> <p> <b>Managing Tables</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p><i>CreateTable</i> - Creates a table with user-specified provisioned throughput settings. You must designate one attribute as the hash primary key for the table; you can optionally designate a second attribute as the range primary key. DynamoDB creates indexes on these key attributes for fast data access. Optionally, you can create one or more secondary indexes, which provide fast data access using non-key attributes.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>DescribeTable</i> - Returns metadata for a table, such as table size, status, and index information.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>UpdateTable</i> - Modifies the provisioned throughput settings for a table. Optionally, you can modify the provisioned throughput settings for global secondary indexes on the table.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>ListTables</i> - Returns a list of all tables associated with the current AWS account and endpoint.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>DeleteTable</i> - Deletes a table and all of its indexes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For conceptual information about managing tables, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html\">Working with Tables</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Reading Data</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p><i>GetItem</i> - Returns a set of attributes for the item that has a given primary key. By default, <i>GetItem</i> performs an eventually consistent read; however, applications can request a strongly consistent read instead.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>BatchGetItem</i> - Performs multiple <i>GetItem</i> requests for data items using their primary keys, from one table or multiple tables. The response from <i>BatchGetItem</i> has a size limit of 16 MB and returns a maximum of 100 items. Both eventually consistent and strongly consistent reads can be used.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Query</i> - Returns one or more items from a table or a secondary index. You must provide a specific hash key value. You can narrow the scope of the query using comparison operators against a range key value, or on the index key. <i>Query</i> supports either eventual or strong consistency. A single response has a size limit of 1 MB.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Scan</i> - Reads every item in a table; the result set is eventually consistent. You can limit the number of items returned by filtering the data attributes, using conditional expressions. <i>Scan</i> can be used to enable ad-hoc querying of a table against non-key attributes; however, since this is a full table scan without using an index, <i>Scan</i> should not be used for any application query use case that requires predictable performance.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For conceptual information about reading data, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html\">Working with Items</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/QueryAndScan.html\">Query and Scan Operations</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Modifying Data</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p><i>PutItem</i> - Creates a new item, or replaces an existing item with a new item (including all the attributes). By default, if an item in the table already exists with the same primary key, the new item completely replaces the existing item. You can use conditional operators to replace an item only if its attribute values match certain conditions, or to insert a new item only if that item doesn't already exist.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>UpdateItem</i> - Modifies the attributes of an existing item. You can also use conditional operators to perform an update only if the item's attribute values match certain conditions.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>DeleteItem</i> - Deletes an item in a table by primary key. You can use conditional operators to perform a delete an item only if the item's attribute values match certain conditions.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>BatchWriteItem</i> - Performs multiple <i>PutItem</i> and <i>DeleteItem</i> requests across multiple tables in a single request. A failure of any request(s) in the batch will not cause the entire <i>BatchWriteItem</i> operation to fail. Supports batches of up to 25 items to put or delete, with a maximum total request size of 16 MB. </p> </li> </ul> <p>For conceptual information about modifying data, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html\">Working with Items</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/QueryAndScan.html\">Query and Scan Operations</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p>",

        "AttributeValueUpdate$Action": "<p>Specifies how to perform the update. Valid values are <code>PUT</code> (default), <code>DELETE</code>, and <code>ADD</code>. The behavior depends on whether the specified primary key already exists in the table.</p> <p> <b>If an item with the specified <i>Key</i> is found in the table:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p><code>PUT</code> - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value. </p> </li> <li> <p><code>DELETE</code> - If no value is specified, the attribute and its value are removed from the item. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type.</p> <p>If a <i>set</i> of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[a,b,c]</code> and the <i>DELETE</i> action specified <code>[a,c]</code>, then the final attribute value would be <code>[b]</code>. Specifying an empty set is an error.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ADD</code> - If the attribute does not already exist, then the attribute and its values are added to the item. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of <code>ADD</code> depends on the data type of the attribute:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the existing attribute is a number, and if <i>Value</i> is also a number, then the <i>Value</i> is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If <i>Value</i> is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.</p> <note> <p> If you use <code>ADD</code> to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value.</p> <p>In addition, if you use <code>ADD</code> to update an existing item, and intend to increment or decrement an attribute value which does not yet exist, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update does not yet have an attribute named <i>itemcount</i>, but you decide to <code>ADD</code> the number <code>3</code> to this attribute anyway, even though it currently does not exist. DynamoDB will create the <i>itemcount</i> attribute, set its initial value to <code>0</code>, and finally add <code>3</code> to it. The result will be a new <i>itemcount</i> attribute in the item, with a value of <code>3</code>.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p>If the existing data type is a set, and if the <i>Value</i> is also a set, then the <i>Value</i> is added to the existing set. (This is a <i>set</i> operation, not mathematical addition.) For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[1,2]</code>, and the <code>ADD</code> action specified <code>[3]</code>, then the final attribute value would be <code>[1,2,3]</code>. An error occurs if an Add action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. </p> <p>Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the <i>Value</i> must also be a set of strings. The same holds true for number sets and binary sets.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is number or is a set. Do not use <code>ADD</code> for any other data types.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>If no item with the specified <i>Key</i> is found:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p><code>PUT</code> - DynamoDB creates a new item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute. </p> </li> <li> <p><code>DELETE</code> - Nothing happens; there is no attribute to delete.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ADD</code> - DynamoDB creates an item with the supplied primary key and number (or set of numbers) for the attribute value.

Set type attributes must not be empty. Requests with empty values will be rejected with a <i>ValidationException</i> exception.</p> <p>Each <i>AttributeUpdates</i> element consists of an attribute name to modify, along with the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p><i>Value</i> - The new value, if applicable, for this attribute.</p> </li> <li> <p><i>Action</i> - A value that specifies how to perform the update. This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is Number or is a set; do not use <code>ADD</code> for other data types. </p> <p>If an item with the specified primary key is found in the table, the following values perform the following actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>PUT</code> - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value. </p> </li> <li> <p><code>DELETE</code> - Removes the attribute and its value, if no value is specified for <code>DELETE</code>. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type.</p> <p>If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[a,b,c]</code> and the <code>DELETE</code> action specifies <code>[a,c]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[b]</code>. Specifying an empty set is an error.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ADD</code> - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of <code>ADD</code> depends on the data type of the attribute:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the existing attribute is a number, and if <i>Value</i> is also a number, then <i>Value</i> is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If <i>Value</i> is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.</p> <note> <p>If you use <code>ADD</code> to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value.</p> <p>Similarly, if you use <code>ADD</code> for an existing item to increment or decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update doesn't have an attribute named <i>itemcount</i>, but you decide to <code>ADD</code> the number <code>3</code> to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the <i>itemcount</i> attribute, set its initial value to <code>0</code>, and finally add <code>3</code> to it. The result will be a new <i>itemcount</i> attribute, with a value of <code>3</code>.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p>If the existing data type is a set, and if <i>Value</i> is also a set, then <i>Value</i> is appended to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set <code>[1,2]</code>, and the <code>ADD</code> action specified <code>[3]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[1,2,3]</code>. An error occurs if an <code>ADD</code> action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. </p> <p>Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, <i>Value</i> must also be a set of strings.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If no item with the specified key is found in the table, the following values perform the following actions: </p> <ul> <li> <p><code>PUT</code> - Causes DynamoDB to create a new item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute. </p> </li> <li> <p><code>DELETE</code> - Nothing happens, because attributes cannot be deleted from a nonexistent item. The operation succeeds, but DynamoDB does not create a new item.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ADD</code> - Causes DynamoDB to create an item with the supplied primary key and number (or set of numbers) for the attribute value.

If any of these attribute already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You can also use <code>SET</code> to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: <code>SET myNum = myNum + :val</code></p> <p><code>SET</code> supports the following functions:</p> <ul> <li><p><code>if_not_exists (path, operand)</code> - if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then <code>if_not_exists</code> evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item.</p></li> <li><p><code>list_append (operand, operand)</code> - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it. You can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands.</p></li> </ul> <p>These function names are case-sensitive.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>REMOVE</code> - Removes one or more attributes from an item.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>ADD</code> - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of <code>ADD</code> depends on the data type of the attribute:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the existing attribute is a number, and if <i>Value</i> is also a number, then <i>Value</i> is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If <i>Value</i> is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.</p> <note> <p>If you use <code>ADD</code> to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value.</p> <p>Similarly, if you use <code>ADD</code> for an existing item to increment or decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses <code>0</code> as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update doesn't have an attribute named <i>itemcount</i>, but you decide to <code>ADD</code> the number <code>3</code> to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the <i>itemcount</i> attribute, set its initial value to <code>0</code>, and finally add <code>3</code> to it. The result will be a new <i>itemcount</i> attribute in the item, with a value of <code>3</code>.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p>If the existing data type is a set and if <i>Value</i> is also a set, then <i>Value</i> is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set <code>[1,2]</code>, and the <code>ADD</code> action specified <code>[3]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[1,2,3]</code>. An error occurs if an <code>ADD</code> action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. </p> <p>Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the <i>Value</i> must also be a set of strings.</p> </li> </ul> <important><p>The <code>ADD</code> action only supports Number and set data types. In addition, <code>ADD</code> can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.</p> </important> </li> <li> <p><code>DELETE</code> - Deletes an element from a set.</p> <p>If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set <code>[a,b,c]</code> and the <code>DELETE</code> action specifies <code>[a,c]</code>, then the final attribute value is <code>[b]</code>. Specifying an empty set is an error.</p> <important><p>The <code>DELETE</code> action only supports set data types. In addition, <code>DELETE</code> can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.</p> </important> </li> </ul> <p>You can have many actions in a single expression, such as the following: <code>SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5</code></p> <p>For more information on update expressions, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.Modifying.html\">Modifying Items and Attributes</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> <note><p><i>UpdateExpression</i> replaces the legacy <i>AttributeUpdates</i> parameter.</p></note>"
