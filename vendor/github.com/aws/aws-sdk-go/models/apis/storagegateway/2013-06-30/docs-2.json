    "RemoveTagsFromResource": "<p>This operation removes one or more tags from the specified resource.</p>",
    "ResetCache": "<p>This operation resets all cache disks that have encountered a error and makes the disks available for reconfiguration as cache storage. If your cache disk encounters a error, the gateway prevents read and write operations on virtual tapes in the gateway. For example, an error can occur when a disk is corrupted or removed from the gateway. When a cache is reset, the gateway loses its cache storage. At this point you can reconfigure the disks as cache disks. </p> <important> <p>If the cache disk you are resetting contains data that has not been uploaded to Amazon S3 yet, that data can be lost.

The virtual tape can be retrieved to only a gateway-VTL. There is no charge for retrieving recovery points.</note>",
    "ShutdownGateway": "<p>This operation shuts down a gateway. To specify which gateway to shut down, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of your request.</p> <p>The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the storage gateway's virtual machine (VM) and not the VM.</p> <note>If you want to shut down the VM, it is recommended that you first shut down the gateway component in the VM to avoid unpredictable conditions.</note> <p>After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except <a>StartGateway</a>, <a>DescribeGatewayInformation</a>, and <a>ListGateways</a>. For more information, see <a>ActivateGateway</a>. Your applications cannot read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes, and there are no snapshots taken.</p> <note>When you make a shutdown request, you will get a <code>200 OK</code> success response immediately.

    "UpdateBandwidthRateLimit": "<p>This operation updates the bandwidth rate limits of a gateway. You can update both the upload and download bandwidth rate limit or specify only one of the two. If you don't set a bandwidth rate limit, the existing rate limit remains.</p> <p>By default, a gateway's bandwidth rate limits are not set. If you don't set any limit, the gateway does not have any limitations on its bandwidth usage and could potentially use the maximum available bandwidth.</p> <p>To specify which gateway to update, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.</p>",
    "UpdateChapCredentials": "<p>This operation updates the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) credentials for a specified iSCSI target.

The request immediately triggers the software update. </p> <note>When you make this request, you get a <code>200 OK</code> success response immediately. However, it might take some time for the update to complete. You can call <a>DescribeGatewayInformation</a> to verify the gateway is in the <code>STATE_RUNNING</code> state.</note> <important>A software update forces a system restart of your gateway. You can minimize the chance of any disruption to your applications by increasing your iSCSI Initiators' timeouts. For more information about increasing iSCSI Initiator timeouts for Windows and Linux, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorWindowsClient.html#CustomizeWindowsiSCSISettings\">Customizing Your Windows iSCSI Settings</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorRedHatClient.html#CustomizeLinuxiSCSISettings\">Customizing Your Linux iSCSI Settings</a>, respectively.</important>",
    "UpdateMaintenanceStartTime": "<p>This operation updates a gateway's weekly maintenance start time information, including day and time of the week. The maintenance time is the time in your gateway's time zone.</p>",
    "UpdateSnapshotSchedule": "<p>This operation updates a snapshot schedule configured for a gateway volume.</p> <p>The default snapshot schedule for volume is once every 24 hours, starting at the creation time of the volume. You can use this API to change the snapshot schedule configured for the volume.</p> <p>In the request you must identify the gateway volume whose snapshot schedule you want to update, and the schedule information, including when you want the snapshot to begin on a day and the frequency (in hours) of snapshots.</p>",
    "UpdateVTLDeviceType": "<p>This operation updates the type of medium changer in a gateway-VTL. When you activate a gateway-VTL, you select a medium changer type for the gateway-VTL. This operation enables you to select a different type of medium changer after a gateway-VTL is activated.</p>"
