  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Relational Database Service</fullname> <p> Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique. </p> <p> Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Oracle database server. This means the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your database instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use. </p> <p> This is an interface reference for Amazon RDS. It contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Note that Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon RDS interfaces, go to <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html#Welcome.Interfaces\">Available RDS Interfaces</a>. </p>",

    "AuthorizeDBSecurityGroupIngress": "<p> Enables ingress to a DBSecurityGroup using one of two forms of authorization. First, EC2 or VPC security groups can be added to the DBSecurityGroup if the application using the database is running on EC2 or VPC instances. Second, IP ranges are available if the application accessing your database is running on the Internet. Required parameters for this API are one of CIDR range, EC2SecurityGroupId for VPC, or (EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId and either EC2SecurityGroupName or EC2SecurityGroupId for non-VPC). </p> <note> You cannot authorize ingress from an EC2 security group in one Region to an Amazon RDS DB instance in another. You cannot authorize ingress from a VPC security group in one VPC to an Amazon RDS DB instance in another. </note> <p>For an overview of CIDR ranges, go to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing\">Wikipedia Tutorial</a>. </p>",

Once you've created a DB parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB instance using <i>ModifyDBInstance</i>. When you associate a new DB parameter group with a running DB instance, you need to reboot the DB instance without failover for the new DB parameter group and associated settings to take effect. </p> <important> <p>After you create a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <code>character_set_database</code> parameter.

    "RebootDBInstance": "<p> Rebooting a DB instance restarts the database engine service. A reboot also applies to the DB instance any modifications to the associated DB parameter group that were pending. Rebooting a DB instance results in a momentary outage of the instance, during which the DB instance status is set to rebooting. If the RDS instance is configured for MultiAZ, it is possible that the reboot will be conducted through a failover. An Amazon RDS event is created when the reboot is completed. </p> <p> If your DB instance is deployed in multiple Availability Zones, you can force a failover from one AZ to the other during the reboot. You might force a failover to test the availability of your DB instance deployment or to restore operations to the original AZ after a failover occurs. </p> <p> The time required to reboot is a function of the specific database engine's crash recovery process. To improve the reboot time, we recommend that you reduce database activities as much as possible during the reboot process to reduce rollback activity for in-transit transactions. </p>",

    "RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot": "<p>Creates a new DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is created from the source database restore point with the same configuration as the original source database, except that the new RDS instance is created with the default security group. </p> <p>If your intent is to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored DB instance, then rename your original DB instance before you call the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action. RDS does not allow two DB instances with the same name. Once you have renamed your original DB instance with a different identifier, then you can pass the original name of the DB instance as the DBInstanceIdentifier in the call to the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action. The result is that you will replace the original DB instance with the DB instance created from the snapshot.</p>",
    "RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime": "<p> Restores a DB instance to an arbitrary point-in-time. Users can restore to any point in time before the LatestRestorableTime for up to BackupRetentionPeriod days.
