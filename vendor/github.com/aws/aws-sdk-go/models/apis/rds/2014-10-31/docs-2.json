  "service": "<fullname>Amazon Relational Database Service</fullname> <p> </p> <p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.</p> <p>Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your database instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.</p> <p>This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Note that Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide.</p> <p> <b>Amazon RDS API Reference</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>For the alphabetical list of API actions, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html\">API Actions</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For the alphabetical list of data types, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html\">Data Types</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For a list of common query parameters, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html\">Common Parameters</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For descriptions of the error codes, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html\">Common Errors</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon RDS User Guide</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>For a summary of the Amazon RDS interfaces, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html#Welcome.Interfaces\">Available RDS Interfaces</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For more information about how to use the Query API, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Using_the_Query_API.html\">Using the Query API</a>.</p> </li> </ul>",

Changes to static parameters require a reboot without failover to the DB instance associated with the parameter group before the change can take effect.</p> </note> <important> <p>After you modify a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the modify action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <code>character_set_database</code> parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i> option of the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/\">Amazon RDS console</a> or the <i>DescribeDBParameters</i> command to verify that your DB parameter group has been created or modified.</p> </important>",

If the RDS instance is configured for MultiAZ, it is possible that the reboot will be conducted through a failover. An Amazon RDS event is created when the reboot is completed.</p> <p>If your DB instance is deployed in multiple Availability Zones, you can force a failover from one AZ to the other during the reboot. You might force a failover to test the availability of your DB instance deployment or to restore operations to the original AZ after a failover occurs.</p> <p>The time required to reboot is a function of the specific database engine's crash recovery process. To improve the reboot time, we recommend that you reduce database activities as much as possible during the reboot process to reduce rollback activity for in-transit transactions.</p>",
