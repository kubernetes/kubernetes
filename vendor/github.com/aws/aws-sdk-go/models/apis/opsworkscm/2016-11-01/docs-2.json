  "service": "<fullname>AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate</fullname> <p> AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate is a service that runs and manages configuration management servers. </p> <p> <b>Glossary of terms</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Server</b>: A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration manager runs on your instances by using various AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and potentially Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Engine</b>: The specific configuration manager that you want to use (such as <code>Chef</code>) is the engine.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Backup</b>: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. A backup creates a .tar.gz file that is stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket in your account. AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate creates the S3 bucket when you launch the first instance. A backup maintains a snapshot of all of a server's important attributes at the time of the backup.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Events</b>: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>AccountAttributes</b>: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate database. These attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Chef servers can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.</p> <ul> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Throttling limits</b> </p> <p>All API operations allow for five requests per second with a burst of 10 requests per second.</p>",

    "AssociateNode": "<p> Associates a new node with the Chef server. This command is an alternative to <code>knife bootstrap</code>. For more information about how to disassociate a node, see <a>DisassociateNode</a>.</p> <p> A node can can only be associated with servers that are in a <code>HEALTHY</code> state. Otherwise, an <code>InvalidStateException</code> is thrown. A <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> is thrown when the server does not exist. A <code>ValidationException</code> is raised when parameters of the request are not valid. The AssociateNode API call can be integrated into Auto Scaling configurations, AWS Cloudformation templates, or the user data of a server's instance. </p> <p> Example: <code>aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name <i>MyServer</i> --node-name <i>MyManagedNode</i> --engine-attributes \"Name=<i>MyOrganization</i>,Value=default\" \"Name=<i>Chef_node_public_key</i>,Value=<i>Public_key_contents</i>\"</code> </p>",
    "CreateBackup": "<p> Creates an application-level backup of a server. While the server is in the <code>BACKING_UP</code> state, the server cannot be changed, and no additional backup can be created. </p> <p> Backups can be created for servers in <code>RUNNING</code>, <code>HEALTHY</code>, and <code>UNHEALTHY</code> states. By default, you can create a maximum of 50 manual backups. </p> <p> This operation is asynchronous. </p> <p> A <code>LimitExceededException</code> is thrown when the maximum number of manual backups is reached. An <code>InvalidStateException</code> is thrown when the server is not in any of the following states: RUNNING, HEALTHY, or UNHEALTHY. A <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> is thrown when the server is not found. A <code>ValidationException</code> is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid. </p>",
    "CreateServer": "<p> Creates and immedately starts a new server. The server is ready to use when it is in the <code>HEALTHY</code> state. By default, you can create a maximum of 10 servers. </p> <p> This operation is asynchronous. </p> <p> A <code>LimitExceededException</code> is thrown when you have created the maximum number of servers (10). A <code>ResourceAlreadyExistsException</code> is thrown when a server with the same name already exists in the account. A <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> is thrown when you specify a backup ID that is not valid or is for a backup that does not exist. A <code>ValidationException</code> is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid. </p> <p> If you do not specify a security group by adding the <code>SecurityGroupIds</code> parameter, AWS OpsWorks creates a new security group. The default security group opens the Chef server to the world on TCP port 443. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22. </p> <p>By default, the Chef Server is accessible from any IP address. We recommend that you update your security group rules to allow access from known IP addresses and address ranges only. To edit security group rules, open Security Groups in the navigation pane of the EC2 management console. </p>",
    "DeleteBackup": "<p> Deletes a backup. You can delete both manual and automated backups.
