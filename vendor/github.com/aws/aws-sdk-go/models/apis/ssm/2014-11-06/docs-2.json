  "service": "<fullname>Amazon EC2 Systems Manager</fullname> <p>Amazon EC2 Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as collecting system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. A <i>managed instance</i> is any Amazon EC2 instance or on-premises machine in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager.</p> <p>This reference is intended to be used with the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/\">Amazon EC2 Systems Manager User Guide</a>.</p> <p>To get started, verify prerequisites and configure managed instances. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html\">Systems Manager Prerequisites</a>.</p> <p>For information about other API actions you can perform on Amazon EC2 instances, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/\">Amazon EC2 API Reference</a>.

  "operations": {
    "AddTagsToResource": "<p>Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents, managed instances, Maintenance Windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. For example: Key=Owner and Value=DbAdmin, SysAdmin, or Dev. Or Key=Stack and Value=Production, Pre-Production, or Test.</p> <p>Each resource can have a maximum of 10 tags. </p> <p>We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon EC2 and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. </p> <p>For more information about tags, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html\">Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p>",

To check the status of the sync, use the <a href=\"API_ListResourceDataSync.html\">ListResourceDataSync</a> operation.</p> <p>By default, data is not encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy. To view an example of a restrictive Amazon S3 bucket policy for Resource Data Sync, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-configuring.html#sysman-inventory-datasync\">Configuring Resource Data Sync for Inventory</a>.</p>",
