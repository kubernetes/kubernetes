  "service": "<p>Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change state, they automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a pre-determined schedule. For example, you can configure rules to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis stream for detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about the features of Amazon CloudWatch Events, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events\">Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</a>.</p>",

CloudWatch Events rules in your account are triggered by these events arriving to your default event bus. </p> <p>For another account to send events to your account, that external account must have a CloudWatch Events rule with your account's default event bus as a target.</p> <p>To enable multiple AWS accounts to put events to your default event bus, run <code>PutPermission</code> once for each of these accounts.</p> <p>The permission policy on the default event bus cannot exceed 10KB in size.</p>",
    "PutRule": "<p>Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default, or based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using <a>DisableRule</a>.</p> <p>When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to new or updated rules.

Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.</p>",
    "PutTargets": "<p>Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if they are already associated with the rule.</p> <p>Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered.</p> <p>You can configure the following as targets for CloudWatch Events:</p> <ul> <li> <p>EC2 instances</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS Lambda functions</p> </li> <li> <p>Streams in Amazon Kinesis Streams</p> </li> <li> <p>Delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Firehose</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon ECS tasks</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS Step Functions state machines</p> </li> <li> <p>Pipelines in Amazon Code Pipeline</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon Inspector assessment templates</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon SNS topics</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon SQS queues</p> </li> <li> <p>The default event bus of another AWS account</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note that creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the AWS Management Console.</p> <p>For some target types, <code>PutTargets</code> provides target-specific parameters. If the target is an Amazon Kinesis stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the <code>KinesisParameters</code> argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the <code>RunCommandParameters</code> field.</p> <p>To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon CloudWatch Events needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, CloudWatch Events relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Amazon Kinesis streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines, CloudWatch Events relies on IAM roles that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/auth-and-access-control-cwe.html\">Authentication and Access Control</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using <code>PutPermission</code>), you can send events to that account by setting that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> when you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to antoher account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information on pricing, see <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/\">Amazon CloudWatch Pricing</a>.</p> <p>For more information about enabling cross-account events, see <a>PutPermission</a>.</p> <p> <b>Input</b>, <b>InputPath</b> and <b>InputTransformer</b> are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON form (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target).</p> </li> <li> <p>If <b>Input</b> is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant.</p> </li> <li> <p>If <b>InputPath</b> is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, <code>$.detail</code>), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed).</p> </li> <li> <p>If <b>InputTransformer</b> is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.</p> </li> </ul> <p>When you specify <code>Input</code>, <code>InputPath</code>, or <code>InputTransformer</code>, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation.</p> <p>When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Please allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.</p> <p>This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time.
