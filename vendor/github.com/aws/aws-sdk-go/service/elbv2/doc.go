// Package elbv2 provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Elastic Load Balancing.
//
// A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as your
// EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the availability of your application.
// The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and
// ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your
// load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners,
// which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from
// clients to the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol
// and port number for connections from the load balancer to the targets, and
// with health check settings to be used when checking the health status of
// the targets.
//
// Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application
// Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, and Classic
// Load Balancers. This reference covers the following load balancer types:
//
//   - Application Load Balancer - Operates at the application layer (layer
//     7) and supports HTTP and HTTPS.
//
//   - Network Load Balancer - Operates at the transport layer (layer 4) and
//     supports TCP, TLS, and UDP.
//
//   - Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer 3).
//
// For more information, see the Elastic Load Balancing User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/).
//
// All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they
// complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/elasticloadbalancingv2-2015-12-01 for more information on this service.

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Elastic Load Balancing with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

//
// See the Elastic Load Balancing client ELBV2 for more
// information on creating client for this service.
