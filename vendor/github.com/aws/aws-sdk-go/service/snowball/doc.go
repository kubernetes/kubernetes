// Package snowball provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Import/Export Snowball.
//
// AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
// appliances to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data
// centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snowball commands
// described here provide access to the same functionality that is available
// in the AWS Snowball Management Console, which enables you to create and manage
// jobs for Snowball. To transfer data locally with a Snowball appliance, you'll
// need to use the Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball.
// For more information, see the User Guide (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/snowball-2016-06-30 for more information on this service.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To Amazon Import/Export Snowball with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
