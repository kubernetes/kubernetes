// You can scale by provisioning multiple shards. Your application should have

// The partition key is used by Amazon Kinesis as input to a hash function
// that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5
// hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and
// to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism,
// all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within
// the stream. For more information, see Adding Data to a Stream (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream)
// in the Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide.
//
// Each record in the Records array may include an optional parameter, ExplicitHashKey,
// which overrides the partition key to shard mapping. This parameter allows
// a data producer to determine explicitly the shard where the record is stored.
// For more information, see Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords)
// in the Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide.
//
// The PutRecords response includes an array of response Records. Each record
// in the response array directly correlates with a record in the request array
// using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request and response.
// The response Records array always includes the same number of records as
// the request array.
//
// The response Records array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully
// processed records. Amazon Kinesis attempts to process all records in each
// PutRecords request. A single record failure does not stop the processing
// of subsequent records.
//
// A successfully-processed record includes ShardId and SequenceNumber values.
// The ShardId parameter identifies the shard in the stream where the record
// is stored. The SequenceNumber parameter is an identifier assigned to the
// put record, unique to all records in the stream.
//
// An unsuccessfully-processed record includes ErrorCode and ErrorMessage values.
// ErrorCode reflects the type of error and can be one of the following values:
// ProvisionedThroughputExceededException or InternalFailure. ErrorMessage provides
// more detailed information about the ProvisionedThroughputExceededException
// exception including the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record
// that was throttled. For more information about partially successful responses,
// see Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords)

// capacity to ingest and transport data. SplitShard is called when there is
// a need to increase the overall capacity of stream because of an expected
// increase in the volume of data records being ingested.
//
// You can also use SplitShard when a shard appears to be approaching its maximum
// utilization, for example, when the set of producers sending data into the
// specific shard are suddenly sending more than previously anticipated. You
// can also call SplitShard to increase stream capacity, so that more Amazon
// Kinesis applications can simultaneously read data from the stream for real-time
// processing.
//
// You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the
// position in the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many cases, the
// new hash key might simply be the average of the beginning and ending hash
// key, but it can be any hash key value in the range being mapped into the
// shard. For more information about splitting shards, see Split a Shard (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-split.html)

// SplitShard is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a SplitShard request,
// Amazon Kinesis immediately returns a response and sets the stream status
// to UPDATING. After the operation is completed, Amazon Kinesis sets the stream
// status to ACTIVE. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream
// is in the UPDATING state.

// You can use DescribeStream to check the status of the stream, which is returned
// in StreamStatus. If the stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can call SplitShard.
