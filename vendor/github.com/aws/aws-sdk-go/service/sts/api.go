// Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access
// key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) that you can use to access
// AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. Typically, you
// use AssumeRole for cross-account access or federation.
//
// Important: You cannot call AssumeRole by using AWS account credentials;
// access will be denied. You must use IAM user credentials or temporary security
// credentials to call AssumeRole.
//
// For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need
// to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials
// in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials
// and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming.
// Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account and
// then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts
// by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see
// IAM Roles (Delegation and Federation) (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html)
// in the Using IAM.
//
// For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the
// AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and authentication
// system in your corporate network, you don't have to recreate user identities
// in AWS in order to grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead, after
// a user has been authenticated, you call AssumeRole (and specify the role
// with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials for
// that user. With those temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in
// URL that users can use to access the console. For more information, see Common
// Scenarios for Temporary Credentials (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html#sts-introduction)
// in the Using IAM.
//
// The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that you specified
// when calling AssumeRole, which can be from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 3600
// seconds (1 hour). The default is 1 hour.
//
// Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you
// choose not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are
// returned by the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access
// policy of the role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this operation,
// the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have
// the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that
// is being assumed, and the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further
// restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials.
// You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess
// of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed.
// For more information, see Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML,
// and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html)
// in the Using IAM.
//
// To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust
// relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created.
// You must also have a policy that allows you to call sts:AssumeRole.
//
//  Using MFA with AssumeRole
//
// You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information
// when you call AssumeRole. This is useful for cross-account scenarios in which
// you want to make sure that the user who is assuming the role has been authenticated
// using an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being
// assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication; if the caller
// does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is
// denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication
// might look like the following example.
//
//  "Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}
//
// For more information, see Configuring MFA-Protected API Access (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html)
// in the Using IAM guide.
//
// To use MFA with AssumeRole, you pass values for the SerialNumber and TokenCode
// parameters. The SerialNumber value identifies the user's hardware or virtual
// MFA device. The TokenCode is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that
// the MFA devices produces.

//  Calling AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity does not require the use of AWS security

//
// Before your application can call AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, you must have

//
//   If you are creating a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate

// For more information, see Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider
// (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity).
//
//  The GetFederationToken action must be called by using the long-term AWS
// security credentials of an IAM user. You can also call GetFederationToken
// using the security credentials of an AWS account (root), but this is not
// recommended. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose
// of the proxy application and then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits
// federated users to only the actions and resources they need access to. For
// more information, see IAM Best Practices (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
// in the Using IAM.
//
// The temporary security credentials that are obtained by using the long-term
// credentials of an IAM user are valid for the specified duration, between

// that are obtained by using AWS account (root) credentials have a maximum
// duration of 3600 seconds (1 hour)
//
//  Permissions
//
// The permissions for the temporary security credentials returned by GetFederationToken
// are determined by a combination of the following:
//
//  The policy or policies that are attached to the IAM user whose credentials
// are used to call GetFederationToken. The policy that is passed as a parameter
// in the call.  The passed policy is attached to the temporary security credentials
// that result from the GetFederationToken API call--that is, to the federated
// user. When the federated user makes an AWS request, AWS evaluates the policy
// attached to the federated user in combination with the policy or policies
// attached to the IAM user whose credentials were used to call GetFederationToken.
// AWS allows the federated user's request only when both the federated user
// and the IAM user are explicitly allowed to perform the requested action.
// The passed policy cannot grant more permissions than those that are defined
// in the IAM user policy.
//
// A typical use case is that the permissions of the IAM user whose credentials
// are used to call GetFederationToken are designed to allow access to all the
// actions and resources that any federated user will need. Then, for individual
// users, you pass a policy to the operation that scopes down the permissions
// to a level that's appropriate to that individual user, using a policy that
// allows only a subset of permissions that are granted to the IAM user.
//
// If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security credentials
// have no effective permissions. The only exception is when the temporary security
// credentials are used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy
// that specifically allows the federated user to access the resource.
