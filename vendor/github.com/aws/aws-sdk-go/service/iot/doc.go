// Package iot provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS IoT.
//
// AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected
// things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances)
// and the AWS cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to communicate
// with, configure rules for data processing and integration with other services,
// organize resources associated with each thing (Thing Registry), configure
// logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to authenticate things.
//
// For more information about how AWS IoT works, see the Developer Guide (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/aws-iot-how-it-works.html).
//
// See iot package documentation for more information.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/iot/
//
// Using the Client
//
// To AWS IoT with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/#Config
//
// See the AWS IoT client IoT for more
// information on creating client for this service.
