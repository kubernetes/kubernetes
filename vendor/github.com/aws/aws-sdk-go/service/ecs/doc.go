// Package ecs provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon EC2 Container Service.
//
// Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container
// management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers
// on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-enabled
// applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster
// from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon
// EC2 features like security groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM roles.
//
// You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your
// cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability
// requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to
// operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems
// or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ecs-2014-11-13 for more information on this service.

// See ecs package documentation for more information.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To Amazon EC2 Container Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
