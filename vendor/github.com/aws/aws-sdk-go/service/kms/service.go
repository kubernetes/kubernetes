// AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management
// web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call
// programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the AWS Key
// Management Service Developer Guide (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/).
//
//  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
// programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.).
// The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS
// and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as
// signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically.
// For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install
// them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
//  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to
// AWS KMS.
//
// Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS
// 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy
// (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral
// Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support
// these modes.
//
// Signing Requests
//
// Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key.
// We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account access key ID
// and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key
// ID and secret access key for an IAM user, or you can use the AWS Security
// Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use
// to sign requests.
//
// All AWS KMS operations require Signature Version 4 (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
//
// Logging API Requests
//
// AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related
// events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that
// you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine
// what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made,
// and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and
// find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/).
//
// Additional Resources
//
// For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:
//
//   AWS Security Credentials (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html)
// - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials
// used for accessing AWS.   AWS Security Token Service (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/)
// - This guide describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.
//   Signing AWS API Requests (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html)
// - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using
// an access key ID and a secret access key.   Commonly Used APIs
//
//  Of the APIs discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most
// useful for most applications. You will likely perform actions other than
// these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.
//

//The service client's operations are safe to be used concurrently.
// It is not safe to mutate any of the client's properties though.

// New creates a new instance of the KMS client with a session.
// If additional configuration is needed for the client instance use the optional
// aws.Config parameter to add your extra config.

//     // Create a KMS client with additional configuration
//     svc := kms.New(mySession, aws.NewConfig().WithRegion("us-west-2"))
