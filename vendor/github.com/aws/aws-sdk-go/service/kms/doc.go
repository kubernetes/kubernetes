// Package kms provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Key Management Service.
//
// Key Management Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service.
// This guide describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically.
// For general information about KMS, see the Key Management Service Developer
// Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/).
//
// KMS is replacing the term customer master key (CMK) with KMS key and KMS
// key. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping
// some variations of this term.
//
// Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code
// for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS,
// Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic
// access to KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs
// take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors,
// and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon
// Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools
// for Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic
// API calls to KMS.
//
// Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS
// 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy
// (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral
// Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support
// these modes.
//
// Signing Requests
//
// Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key.
// We strongly recommend that you do not use your Amazon Web Services account
// (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with KMS. Instead,
// use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also
// use the Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to generate temporary
// security credentials that you can use to sign requests.
//
// All KMS operations require Signature Version 4 (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
//
// Logging API Requests
//
// KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls
// and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them
// to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected
// by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made
// the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail,
// including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the CloudTrail User
// Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/).
//

// For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:
//
//    * Amazon Web Services Security Credentials (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html)
//    - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials
//    used to access Amazon Web Services.
//
//    * Temporary Security Credentials (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html)
//    - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary
//    security credentials.
//
//    * Signature Version 4 Signing Process (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)
//    - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request
//    using an access key ID and a secret access key.
//
// Commonly Used API Operations
//
// Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the
// most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other
// than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.
//
//    * Encrypt
//
//    * Decrypt
//
//    * GenerateDataKey
//
//    * GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Key Management Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
