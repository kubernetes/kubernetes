## Introduction

`runc` is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification.

## Releases

`runc` depends on and tracks the [runtime-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) repository.
We will try to make sure that `runc` and the OCI specification major versions stay in lockstep.
This means that `runc` 1.0.0 should implement the 1.0 version of the specification.

You can find official releases of `runc` on the [release](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases) page.

### Security

If you wish to report a security issue, please disclose the issue responsibly
to security@opencontainers.org.

## Building

`runc` currently supports the Linux platform with various architecture support.
It must be built with Go version 1.6 or higher in order for some features to function properly.

In order to enable seccomp support you will need to install `libseccomp` on your platform.
> e.g. `libseccomp-devel` for CentOS, or `libseccomp-dev` for Ubuntu

Otherwise, if you do not want to build `runc` with seccomp support you can add `BUILDTAGS=""` when running make.

```bash
# create a 'github.com/opencontainers' in your GOPATH/src
cd github.com/opencontainers
git clone https://github.com/opencontainers/runc
cd runc

make
sudo make install
```

`runc` will be installed to `/usr/local/sbin/runc` on your system.

#### Build Tags

`runc` supports optional build tags for compiling support of various features.
To add build tags to the make option the `BUILDTAGS` variable must be set.

```bash
make BUILDTAGS='seccomp apparmor'
```

| Build Tag | Feature                            | Dependency  |
|-----------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| seccomp   | Syscall filtering                  | libseccomp  |
| selinux   | selinux process and mount labeling | <none>      |
| apparmor  | apparmor profile support           | libapparmor |
| ambient   | ambient capability support         | kernel 4.3  |


### Running the test suite

`runc` currently supports running its test suite via Docker.
To run the suite just type `make test`.

```bash
make test
```

There are additional make targets for running the tests outside of a container but this is not recommended as the tests are written with the expectation that they can write and remove anywhere.

You can run a specific test case by setting the `TESTFLAGS` variable.

```bash
# make test TESTFLAGS="-run=SomeTestFunction"
```

### Dependencies Management

`runc` uses [vndr](https://github.com/LK4D4/vndr) for dependencies management.
Please refer to [vndr](https://github.com/LK4D4/vndr) for how to add or update
new dependencies.

## Using runc

### Creating an OCI Bundle

In order to use runc you must have your container in the format of an OCI bundle.
If you have Docker installed you can use its `export` method to acquire a root filesystem from an existing Docker container.

```bash
# create the top most bundle directory
mkdir /mycontainer
cd /mycontainer

# create the rootfs directory
mkdir rootfs

# export busybox via Docker into the rootfs directory
docker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -
```

After a root filesystem is populated you just generate a spec in the format of a `config.json` file inside your bundle.
`runc` provides a `spec` command to generate a base template spec that you are then able to edit.
To find features and documentation for fields in the spec please refer to the [specs](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) repository.

```bash
runc spec
```

### Running Containers

Assuming you have an OCI bundle from the previous step you can execute the container in two different ways.

The first way is to use the convenience command `run` that will handle creating, starting, and deleting the container after it exits.

```bash
# run as root
cd /mycontainer
runc run mycontainerid
```

If you used the unmodified `runc spec` template this should give you a `sh` session inside the container.

The second way to start a container is using the specs lifecycle operations.
This gives you more power over how the container is created and managed while it is running.
This will also launch the container in the background so you will have to edit the `config.json` to remove the `terminal` setting for the simple examples here.
Your process field in the `config.json` should look like this below with `"terminal": false` and `"args": ["sleep", "5"]`.


```json
        "process": {
                "terminal": false,
                "user": {
                        "uid": 0,
                        "gid": 0
                },
                "args": [
                        "sleep", "5"
                ],
                "env": [
                        "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
                        "TERM=xterm"
                ],
                "cwd": "/",
                "capabilities": {
                        "bounding": [
                                "CAP_AUDIT_WRITE",
                                "CAP_KILL",
                                "CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE"
                        ],
                        "effective": [
                                "CAP_AUDIT_WRITE",
                                "CAP_KILL",
                                "CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE"
                        ],
                        "inheritable": [
                                "CAP_AUDIT_WRITE",
                                "CAP_KILL",
                                "CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE"
                        ],
                        "permitted": [
                                "CAP_AUDIT_WRITE",
                                "CAP_KILL",
                                "CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE"
                        ],
                        "ambient": [
                                "CAP_AUDIT_WRITE",
                                "CAP_KILL",
                                "CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE"
                        ]
                },
                "rlimits": [
                        {
                                "type": "RLIMIT_NOFILE",
                                "hard": 1024,
                                "soft": 1024
                        }
                ],
                "noNewPrivileges": true
        },
```

Now we can go through the lifecycle operations in your shell.


```bash
# run as root
cd /mycontainer
runc create mycontainerid

# view the container is created and in the "created" state
runc list

# start the process inside the container
runc start mycontainerid

# after 5 seconds view that the container has exited and is now in the stopped state
runc list

# now delete the container
runc delete mycontainerid
```

This adds more complexity but allows higher level systems to manage runc and provides points in the containers creation to setup various settings after the container has created and/or before it is deleted.
This is commonly used to setup the container's network stack after `create` but before `start` where the user's defined process will be running.

#### Rootless containers
`runc` has the ability to run containers without root privileges. This is called `rootless`. You need to pass some parameters to `runc` in order to run rootless containers. See below and compare with the previous version. Run the following commands as an ordinary user:
```bash
# Same as the first example
mkdir ~/mycontainer
cd ~/mycontainer
mkdir rootfs
docker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -

# The --rootless parameter instructs runc spec to generate a configuration for a rootless container, which will allow you to run the container as a non-root user.
runc spec --rootless

# The --root parameter tells runc where to store the container state. It must be writable by the user.
runc --root /tmp/runc run mycontainerid
```

#### Supervisors

`runc` can be used with process supervisors and init systems to ensure that containers are restarted when they exit.
An example systemd unit file looks something like this.

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Start My Container

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/runc run -d --pid-file /run/mycontainerid.pid mycontainerid
ExecStopPost=/usr/local/sbin/runc delete mycontainerid
WorkingDirectory=/mycontainer
PIDFile=/run/mycontainerid.pid

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
