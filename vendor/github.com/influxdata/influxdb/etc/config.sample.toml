### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# The values in this file override the default values used by the system if
# a config option is not specified.  The commented out lines are the the configuration
# field and the default value used.  Uncommentting a line and changing the value
# will change the value used at runtime when the process is restarted.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report usage data to usage.influxdata.com
# The data includes a random ID, os, arch, version, the number of series and other
# usage data. No data from user databases is ever transmitted.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
# reporting-disabled = false

# we'll try to get the hostname automatically, but if it the os returns something
# that isn't resolvable by other servers in the cluster, use this option to
# manually set the hostname
# hostname = "localhost"

### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.
###

###
### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.

### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database

### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.
