	[Org."Core maintainers"]

	# The Core maintainers are the ghostbusters of the project: when there's a problem others
	# can't solve, they show up and fix it with bizarre devices and weaponry.
	# They have final say on technical implementation and coding style.
	# They are ultimately responsible for quality in all its forms: usability polish,
	# bugfixes, performance, stability, etc. When ownership  can cleanly be passed to
	# a subsystem, they are responsible for doing so and holding the
	# subsystem maintainers accountable. If ownership is unclear, they are the de facto owners.

	# For each release (including minor releases), a "release captain" is assigned from the
	# pool of core maintainers. Rotation is encouraged across all maintainers, to ensure
	# the release process is clear and up-to-date.

			# David Calavera contributed many features to Docker, such as an improved
			# event system, dynamic configuration reloading, volume plugins, fancy
			# new templating options, and an external client credential store. As a
			# maintainer, David was release captain for Docker 1.8, and competing
			# with Jess Frazelle to be "top dream killer".
			# David is now doing amazing stuff as CTO for https://www.netlify.com,
			# and tweets as @calavera.
			"calavera",

			# As a maintainer, Erik was responsible for the "builder", and
			# started the first designs for the new networking model in
			# Docker. Erik is now working on all kinds of plugins for Docker
			# (https://github.com/contiv) and various open source projects
			# in his own repository https://github.com/erikh. You may
			# still stumble into him in our issue tracker, or on IRC.
			"erikh",

			# After a false start with his first PR being rejected, James Turnbull became a frequent
			# contributor to the documentation, and became a docs maintainer on December 5, 2013. As
			# a maintainer, James lifted the docs to a higher standard, and introduced the community
			# guidelines ("three strikes"). James is currently changing the world as CTO of https://www.empatico.org,
			# meanwhile authoring various books that are worth checking out. You can find him on Twitter,
			# rambling as @kartar, and although no longer active as a maintainer, he's always "game" to
			# help out reviewing docs PRs, so you may still see him around in the repository.
			"jamtur01",

			# Jessica Frazelle, also known as the "Keyser Söze of containers",
			# runs *everything* in containers. She started contributing to
			# Docker with a (fun fun) change involving both iptables and regular
			# expressions (coz, YOLO!) on July 10, 2014
			# https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/6950/commits/f3a68ffa390fb851115c77783fa4031f1d3b2995.
			# Jess was Release Captain for Docker 1.4, 1.6 and 1.7, and contributed
			# many features and improvement, among which "seccomp profiles" (making
			# containers a lot more secure). Besides being a maintainer, she
			# set up the CI infrastructure for the project, giving everyone
			# something to shout at if a PR failed ("noooo Janky!").
			# Jess is currently working on the DCOS security team at Mesosphere,
			# and contributing to various open source projects.
			# Be sure you don't miss her talks at a conference near you (a must-see),
			# read her blog at https://blog.jessfraz.com (a must-read), and
			# check out her open source projects on GitHub https://github.com/jessfraz (a must-try).
			"jessfraz",

			# As a docs maintainer, Mary Anthony contributed greatly to the Docker
			# docs. She wrote the Docker Contributor Guide and Getting Started
			# Guides. She helped create a doc build system independent of
			# docker/docker project, and implemented a new docs.docker.com theme and
			# nav for 2015 Dockercon. Fun fact: the most inherited layer in DockerHub
			# public repositories was originally referenced in
			# maryatdocker/docker-whale back in May 2015.
			"moxiegirl",

			# Jana Radhakrishnan was part of the SocketPlane team that joined Docker.
			# As a maintainer, he was the lead architect for the Container Network
			# Model (CNM) implemented through libnetwork, and the "routing mesh" powering
			# Swarm mode networking.
			#
			# Jana started new adventures in networking, but you can find him tweeting as @mrjana,
			# coding on GitHub https://github.com/mrjana, and he may be hiding on the Docker Community
			# slack channel :-)
			"mrjana",

			# Sven Dowideit became a well known person in the Docker ecosphere, building
			# boot2docker, and became a regular contributor to the project, starting as
			# early as October 2013 (https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/2119), to become
			# a maintainer less than two months later (https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/3061).
			#
			# As a maintainer, Sven took on the task to convert the documentation from
			# ReStructuredText to Markdown, migrate to Hugo for generating the docs, and
			# writing tooling for building, testing, and publishing them.
			#
			# If you're not in the occasion to visit "the Australian office", you
			# can keep up with Sven on Twitter (@SvenDowideit), his blog http://fosiki.com,
			# and of course on GitHub.
			"sven",

			# Vincent "vbatts!" Batts made his first contribution to the project
			# in November 2013, to become a maintainer a few months later, on
			# May 10, 2014 (https://github.com/docker/docker/commit/d6e666a87a01a5634c250358a94c814bf26cb778).
			# As a maintainer, Vincent made important contributions to core elements
			# of Docker, such as "distribution" (tarsum) and graphdrivers (btrfs, devicemapper).
			# He also contributed the "tar-split" library, an important element
			# for the content-addressable store.
			# Vincent is currently a member of the Open Containers Initiative
			# Technical Oversight Board (TOB), besides his work at Red Hat and
			# Project Atomic. You can still find him regularly hanging out in
			# our repository and the #docker-dev and #docker-maintainers IRC channels
			# for a chat, as he's always a lot of fun.
			"vbatts",

			# Vishnu became a maintainer to help out on the daemon codebase and
			# libcontainer integration. He's currently involved in the
			# Open Containers Initiative, working on the specifications,
			# besides his work on cAdvisor and Kubernetes for Google.
