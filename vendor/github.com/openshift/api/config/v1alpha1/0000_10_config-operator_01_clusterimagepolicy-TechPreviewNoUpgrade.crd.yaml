Otherwise, the identity in the signature must be the same as the image identity. "MatchRepository" means that the identity in the signature must be in the same repository as the image identity. "ExactRepository" means that the identity in the signature must be in the same repository as a specific identity specified by "repository". "RemapIdentity" means that the signature must be in the same as the remapped image identity. Remapped image identity is obtained by replacing the "prefix" with the specified “signedPrefix” if the the image identity matches the specified remapPrefix.
