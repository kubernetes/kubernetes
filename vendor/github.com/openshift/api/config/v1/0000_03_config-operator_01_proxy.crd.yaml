                bundle from the required key \"ca-bundle.crt\", merging it with the
                system default trust bundle, and writing the merged trust bundle to
                a ConfigMap named \"trusted-ca-bundle\" in the \"openshift-config-managed\"
                namespace. Clients that expect to make proxy connections must use
                the trusted-ca-bundle for all HTTPS requests to the proxy, and may
                use the trusted-ca-bundle for non-proxy HTTPS requests as well. \n
