Additionally, this option allows you to retain the pre-2.4 HAProxy behaviour: in HAProxy version 2.2 (OpenShift versions < 4.14), maintaining idle connections during a soft reload was the default behaviour, but starting with HAProxy 2.4, the default changed to closing idle connections immediately.\n\nImportant Consideration:\n\n  - Using Deferred will result in temporary inconsistencies\n    for the first request on each persistent connection\n    after a route update and router reload.

Subsequent requests will use the\n    updated configuration.\n\nOperational Considerations:\n\n  - Keeping idle connections open during reloads may lead\n    to an accumulation of old HAProxy processes if\n    connections remain idle for extended periods,\n    especially in environments where frequent reloads\n    occur.\n\n  - Consider monitoring the number of HAProxy processes in\n    the router pods when Deferred is set.\n\n  - You may need to enable or adjust the\n    `ingress.operator.openshift.io/hard-stop-after`\n    duration (configured via an annotation on the\n    IngressController resource) in environments with\n    frequent reloads to prevent resource exhaustion.",

Increasing this value can prevent the accumulation of HAProxy processes, depending on the scenario. Increasing this interval can also lessen load imbalance on a backend's servers when using the roundrobin balancing algorithm. Alternatively, decreasing this value may decrease latency since updates to HAProxy's configuration can take effect more quickly.\n\nThe value must be a time duration value; see <https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration>. Currently, the minimum value allowed is 1s, and the maximum allowed value is 120s. Minimum and maximum allowed values may change in future versions of OpenShift. Note that if a duration outside of these bounds is provided, the value of reloadInterval will be capped/floored and not rejected (e.g. a duration of over 120s will be capped to 120s; the IngressController will not reject and replace this disallowed value with the default).\n\nA zero value for reloadInterval tells the IngressController to choose the default, which is currently 5s and subject to change without notice.\n\nThis field expects an unsigned duration string of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, e.g. \"300ms\", \"1.5h\" or \"2h45m\". Valid time units are \"ns\", \"us\" (or \"µs\" U+00B5 or \"μs\" U+03BC), \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", \"h\".\n\nNote: Setting a value significantly larger than the default of 5s can cause latency in observing updates to routes and their endpoints. HAProxy's configuration will be reloaded less frequently, and newly created routes will not be served until the subsequent reload.",
