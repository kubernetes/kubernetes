                  of going over the network to a DNS pod on another node.  However,

                  to specific nodes. For example, if a security policy prohibits pods
                  on arbitrary nodes from communicating with the API, a node selector
                  can be specified to restrict DNS pods to nodes that are permitted
                  to communicate with the API.  Conversely, if running DNS pods on
                  nodes with a particular taint is desired, a toleration can be specified
