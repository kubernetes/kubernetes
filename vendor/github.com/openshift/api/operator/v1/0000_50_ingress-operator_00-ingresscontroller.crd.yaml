          deployment is created to allow external traffic to reach the services that
          expose Ingress or Route resources. Updating this resource may lead to disruption

                      will dynamically compute a maximum value based on the available
                      ulimits in the running container. Selecting -1 (i.e., auto)

                      disallowed value with the default). \n A zero value for reloadInterval

                          The load balancer can send HTTP probes on this port on a
                          given node, with the path /healthz/ready to determine if

                          The load balancer should also stop forwarding requests within
