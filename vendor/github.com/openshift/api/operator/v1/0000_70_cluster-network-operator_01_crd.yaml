As the first one is managed by OpenShift's and second by Neutron's IPAMs, those need to come from different pools. Therefore `openStackServiceNetwork` needs to be at least twice the size of `serviceNetwork`, and whole `serviceNetwork` must be overlapping with `openStackServiceNetwork`. cluster-network-operator will then make sure VRRP IPs are taken from the ranges inside `openStackServiceNetwork` that are not overlapping with `serviceNetwork`, effectivly preventing conflicts. If not set cluster-network-operator will use `serviceNetwork` expanded by decrementing the prefix size by 1.
