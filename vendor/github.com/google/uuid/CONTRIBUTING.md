# How to contribute

We definitely welcome patches and contribution to this project!

### Tips

Commits must be formatted according to the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

Always try to include a test case! If it is not possible or not necessary,
please explain why in the pull request description.

### Releasing

Commits that would precipitate a SemVer change, as desrcibed in the Conventional
Commits Specification, will trigger [`release-please`](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action)
to create a release candidate pull request. Once submitted, `release-please`
will create a release.

For tips on how to work with `release-please`, see its documentation.
