# How to contribute

We definitely welcome patches and contribution to grpc! Here is some guideline
and information about how to do so.

## Getting started

### Legal requirements

In order to protect both you and ourselves, you will need to sign the
[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas).

### Filing Issues
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

### Contributing code
Please read the Contribution Guidelines before sending patches.

We will not accept GitHub pull requests once Gerrit is setup (we will use Gerrit instead for code review).

Unless otherwise noted, the Go source files are distributed under the BSD-style license found in the LICENSE file.
